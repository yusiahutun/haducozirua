The song was written for Prince’s 1985 side project The Family. Sinéad O’Connor recorded <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1619676/sinead-o-connor-kids/ rel="noreferrer noopener">her reindition</a> for I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got with her producer Nellee Hooper. “Nothing Compares 2 U” is a heartfelt ballad that depicts extreme longing for a lover.</p><p>O’Connor recalled the moment that she met Prince at his house in her memoir Rememberings. The singer remembered a violent pillow fight between her and the “Purple Rain” musician. “On the first thump I get, I realized he’s got something in the pillow, stuffed down the end, designed to hurt,” she wrote. “He ain’t playing at all. A few more thumps get exchanged and he goes upstairs. But this time, we’ve somehow arrived beside the front door. I open it and run out.”</p><p>When asked about the encounter and her opinion on Prince by <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://people.com/music/sinead-oconnor-remembers-strange-night-prince/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>, she said, “It certainly didn’t change my opinion of him as an artist, which was the only opinion I could have had. I never knew him otherwise. Obviously, I came away not liking him very much and not particularly wanting to go around to see him again. But having said that, though, I won’t lie. I didn’t like the man.”</p><p>She recorded the audiobook for her memoir and recalled, “When I was recording the audio, the thing that messed me up was the Prince chapter,” she told the magazine. “I had to go to bed for a couple of days because I don’t think that I emotionally engaged with it at the time.”</p><p>In 2016, Prince died from a fentanyl overdose. “I sobbed when he died,” O’Connor said. “I just felt terribly sorry and sad for him of the loneliness of his death. The price you pay for being so successful is an awful, aching loneliness, and I think he was terribly lonely, terribly vulnerable.” She added, “The loneliness of fame, I think, was ultimately his undoing.”</p><p>For a brief period of time, she refused to perform the song live. “I don’t want audiences to be disappointed coming along to a show and then not hearing it, so I am letting you know here that you won’t,” she wrote on Facebook. “If I were to sing it just to please people, I wouldn’t be doing my job right, because my job is to be emotionally available. I’d be lying. You’d be getting a lie. My job is to give you honesty. I’m trained in honesty. I can’t act. It just isn’t in my training. I have ceased singing other songs over the years for the same reason.”</p><p>She reversed the decision years later. “You’ve got to be crazy to be a musician,”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>O’Connor told&nbsp;The New York Times&nbsp;in 2021&nbsp;</a>when asked about Prince, “but there’s a difference between being crazy and being a violent abuser of women…As far as I’m concerned, [‘Nothing Compares 2 U’”‘] is my song.”</p><p>However, Prince’s estate refused O’Connor to use her own reinditon of the song in her 2022 documentary Nothing Compares. “I didn’t feel [Sinéad] deserved to use the song my brother wrote in her documentary so we declined,” Prince’s half-sister Sharon Nelson explained&nbsp;to<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.billboard.com/pro/prince-sinead-o-connor-documentary-nothing-compares-2-u/> Billboard.</a> Prince’s estate released a version of the song performed by the late artist in 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=nothing-compares-2-u-by-sinead-o-connor-lyrics>“Nothing Compares 2 U” By Sinéad O’Connor Lyrics</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>Here is “Nothing Compares 2 U” by Sinéad O’Connor lyrics via Genius.</p><p>[Verse 1]<br>It’s been seven hours and fifteen days<br>Since you took your love away<br>I go out every night and sleep all day<br>Since you took your love away<br>Since you’ve been gone I can do whatever I want<br>I can see whomever I choose<br>I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant<br>But nothing, I said, nothing can take away these blues</p><p>[Chorus]<br>‘Cause nothing compares<br>Nothing compares to you</p><p>[Verse 2]<br>It’s been so lonely without you here<br>Like a bird without a song<br>Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling<br>Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?<br>I could put my arms around every boy I see<br>But they’d only remind me of you<br>I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me<br>He said, “Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,” but he’s a fool</p><p>[Chorus]<br>‘Cause nothing compares<br>Nothing compares to you</p><p>[Instrumental Break]</p><p>[Bridge]<br>All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard<br>All died when you went away<br>I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard<br>But I’m willing to give it another try</p><p>[Outro]<br>Nothing compares<br>Nothing compares to you<br>Nothing compares<br>Nothing compares to you<br>Nothing compares<br>Nothing compares to you</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4139PtrW4oL.jpeg><p>Blessed with a singular voice and a fiery temperament,&nbsp;<a data-pmc-sp-product=0f83e7d3debb2ee93adad005f9c2d12e href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Sinéad&nbsp;O’Connor","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Rememberings","price":"16.74","id":"0358423880","category":"Folk & Traditional"},"id":1619965,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Sinéad&nbsp;O’Connor</a> rose to massive fame in the late 1980s and 1990s with a string of gold records.
