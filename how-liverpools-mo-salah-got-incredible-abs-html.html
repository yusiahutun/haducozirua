class=mol-para-with-font>'Whilst weightlifting is essential for muscle growth, Mo definition is also from Pilates,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Muscle definition from Pilates can be

class=mol-para-with-font>'Using a few repetitions targets fast-twitch muscle fibers responsible for strength and power which can lead to hypertrophy (muscle growth) and increased muscle mass if supported by strict protein intake, hydration, calories and enough sleep.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, Pilates focuses on 'controlling each movement slowly'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'[This] will engage both slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle fibres, focusing on muscle lengthening and control.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Because of this, 'muscle

LOW&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The trainer also said Mohamed's routine ensures that he keeps his visceral fat levels low.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'High levels of visceral fat (abdominal fat) can increase risk of some cancers, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes, and the appearance of a pushed out belly,' she explained.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'To keep visceral fat levels low, Mo's cardio routine and no alcohol would be been a big factor in helping him achieve his physique.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'[He] no doubt does cardio, which plays a
