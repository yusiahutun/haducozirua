Their escapades are filled with luxuries that many people are not familiar with. Therefore, you can’t help but wonder just how rich these reality TV stars are.</p><h2>Bling Empire cast net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Who is the wealthiest person in <i>Bling Empire</i>? And who among these high rollers has the least dollars? Below is a detailed look at <i>Bling Empire’s</i> cast net worth and what each member does for a living:</p><h3>1. Anna Shay – $600 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/603db10d7e903dbc.jpg><p class=align-left>Are you wondering who is the richest on <i>Bling Empire</i>? Well, the number one spot goes to Anna Shay. Shay, 60 years old, is the heiress of Edward Shay, the founder of Pacific Architects and Engineers, an American defence contractor company. The company started by offering its service to American military and security agencies during the Vietnam war.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e628475252887734.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 highest-paid black actresses in 2024: Where does Angela Bassett rank?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Today, the company’s clients include the likes of NASA and the United Nations. After the death of Edward Shay, Anna and her brother Allen Shay inherited Pacific Architects and Engineers. In 2006, they sold shares of the company to Lockheed Martin in a cash deal to the tune of $1.2 billion.</p><p class=align-left>With presumably half of the shares being hers, the <i>Bling Empire</i> star inherited roughly about $600 million. With a net worth of around <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">$600 million</a> or more, none of the other <i>Bling Empire</i> cast's net worth can rival her empire. She has over $400 million more in wealth over the second contender.</p><p class=align-left>She leads a lavish lifestyle - currently lives in a $16 million mansion in Beverly Hills, LA. She owns several luxury cars and <a href=#>jewellery pieces</a> and even flies her friends to Paris to dine at her favourite restaurant. With such an amount of wealth, no wonder she was at a loss on what to do with the checks she received for her appearance on <i>Bling Empire</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/da58b2118568f76e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>17 famous celebrities who live in Virginia in 2024 and their homes</span></p></a><h3>2.

One of the things that have captivated viewers about the duo is their unusual relationship. They are not married but have two children together – which is pretty uncommon for Asian culture.</p><p class=align-left>However, that might change soon as Cherie – finally tired of waiting for Jessy to propose – finally popped the question herself. Jessy and Cherie from <i>Bling Empire </i>net worth is estimated to be roughly around <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$200 million</a>. Both come from money, with Cherie being the heiress of a denim empire, while Jessy is the heir to a furniture empire.</p><p class=align-left>But what about their net worth? Jessy Lee is worth approximately<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> $20 million</a> on his own. Cherie makes up a large portion of the couple's wealth due to her family’s successful but undisclosed <a href=#>fashion </a>business.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8c00bca6d69d76ec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who owns the most expensive car in the world?

Cherie was also on her way to becoming a successful Japanese pop star but gave up the dream for a traditional life after her mother vetoed them.</p><h3>3. Christine Chiu and Gabriel Chiu – $80 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/da58b2118568f76e.jpeg><p class=align-left>Next on the list of the wealthiest <i>Bling Empire </i>cast members is a married couple - Christine and Gabriel Chiu.

However, this is not the case. She came from a wealthy <a href=#>family</a> and was the one who founded their plastic surgery business – with her husband being her first employee.</p><p class=align-left>Aside from the wealth, one other thing that captivated the audience of the <i>Bling Empire </i>was Chiu's philanthropy. The couple donates <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">50% of every net dollar</a> that their clinic earns back to the community. Christine Chiu is also a dedicated philanthropist and sits on the board of 27 charity organizations.</p><p class=align-left>Chiu's charitable contributions extend far beyond the USA.
