According to the book, <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> was “shocked” and pulled away when he tried to woo her. A friend of the couple <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Vanity Fair it was clear from the beginning when they met at the University of St Andrews in Scotland that William was “smitten” with the Princess of Wales.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1235941068-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-and-kate-middleton-s-first-kiss-didn-t-go-as-planned>Prince William and Kate Middleton’s first kiss didn’t go as planned</h2><p>Kate and William were classmates at university, beginning in 2001, when they studied art history. However, despite the Prince of Wales’ growing feelings towards Kate, she was then dating someone else, Rupert Finch and he tried to kiss her during this time which could be the big reason for her rejection.</p><p>Even with his blunder, it didn’t mean he wasn’t in for a chance with the now 41-year-old as a friend who witnessed the moment, which happened at a party in a room full of people as they were about to toast to a great evening said Kate “played it very cool.”</p><p>They claim this is because the Princess didn’t “want to give off the wrong impression or make it too easy for Will.”</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Prince William fans gush over the young royal who was a dreamy ‘Disney Prince Charming’</a></strong></p><p>Furthermore, the friend said: “It was clear to us that William was smitten with Kate. He actually told her she was a knockout that night, which caused her to blush. There was definitely chemistry between them.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-royal-butler-remembers-a-young-kate-and-william>Royal butler remembers a young Kate and William</h2><p>In the<a href=#> early years of their relationship</a>, William showed his “romantic side,” as former royal butler Grant Harold remembered fondly. He said he would go to the local pub and see the two of them “just sitting having a drink” like an ordinary couple, and they would go on secret outings to places like the cinema.</p><p>The <a href=#>royal</a> even told of how he helped a young William prepare a dinner for them both, where <a href=#>King Charles’</a> eldest chose Kate’s favorite dessert.</p><p>He explained: “William is a romantic at heart. I remember him asking me to help with a candlelit dinner for Kate to celebrate Valentine’s Day. It was the Valentine’s after they got engaged and shortly before their wedding.‌</p><p>“I was so happy to be involved. I can’t remember exactly what was served but I’m sure William chose Kate’s favorite dessert. He’s got a romantic side.”‌</p><p>He jokingly continued the couple, whose <a href=#>relationship is portrayed in The Crown</a>, may still take covert trips to the cinema and have their takeaways, even with the “responsibilities” they now have.</p><p>“They’re more grown up and have responsibilities as future King and Queen. They take that seriously, but it means they have to be more careful with the everyday things, like pub drinks and date nights. But I’ll bet money they still go incognito to the cinema when they can.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-their-relationship-wasn-t-always-perfect>Their relationship wasn’t always perfect</h2><p>The failed first kiss between Prince William and Kate Middleton may have foreshadowed the 2007 break from their relationship. It was reportedly prompted by William’s choice to not spend New Year’s Eve with Kate and her family, though they were back together just a few months later.</p><p>A former colleague of Kate’s told of how the breakup took place. “It was clear it was William – and definitely a tiff. Around the middle of the day, she was pacing the car park outside the office on her mobile. A few people noticed because it’s a pretty unusual thing to do. She’d deliberately gone outside to take the call because she didn’t want to be overheard.</p><p>“Kate was walking up and down and looking upset as if she was having an argument. But she didn’t cry. Word went ‘round that it was William, and they were having problems. Now it’s clear what it was all about.”</p><p>They continued: “When she came back to the office, she didn’t say a thing and disappeared for the rest of the day. We didn’t think anything about it at the time. But looking back, the call was definitely a girlfriend-boyfriend tiff.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Kate Middleton’s ‘mask’ fell as she laughed in rare moment during a wildlife safari</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eFcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkrGWWnr%2B0wIyaq62dnaXBbsDOZqKiq6NiuKLAxGakopyUobK1u81mm6Kcnql6qLuMraZmqJyWu3A%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-williams-first-attempt-to-kiss-kate-middleton-didnt-go-to-plan.html&text=Prince%20William%27s%20first%20attempt%20to%20kiss%20Kate%20Middleton%20didn%27t%20go%20to%20plan&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-williams-first-attempt-to-kiss-kate-middleton-didnt-go-to-plan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-williams-first-attempt-to-kiss-kate-middleton-didnt-go-to-plan.html&title=Prince%20William%27s%20first%20attempt%20to%20kiss%20Kate%20Middleton%20didn%27t%20go%20to%20plan" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-williams-first-attempt-to-kiss-kate-middleton-didnt-go-to-plan.html&title=Prince%20William%27s%20first%20attempt%20to%20kiss%20Kate%20Middleton%20didn%27t%20go%20to%20plan" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-williams-first-attempt-to-kiss-kate-middleton-didnt-go-to-plan.html&title=Prince%20William%27s%20first%20attempt%20to%20kiss%20Kate%20Middleton%20didn%27t%20go%20to%20plan" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-williams-first-attempt-to-kiss-kate-middleton-didnt-go-to-plan.html&description=Prince%20William%27s%20first%20attempt%20to%20kiss%20Kate%20Middleton%20didn%27t%20go%20to%20plan" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./7-interesting-facts-about-portugal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 7 Interesting Facts About Portugal">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-open-jar-files-windows.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Open JAR Files on Windows 10 and 11">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
