Although Jon Bon Jovi’s daughter’s first words were “I’m alright”, the conversation they had thereafter was the ‘worst moment’ he’s had as a dad. The <a href=#>music</a> legend said the ‘horrible’ moment finding out his daughter had overdosed on heroin was a problem he didn’t realize was more common than people think.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jon-bon-jovi-s-daughter-called-him-from-hospital>Jon Bon Jovi’s daughter called him from hospital</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-137728866-1024x800.jpg><p>The 61-year-old previously opened up over the devastating moment with The Mirror, where he explained he was asleep when he heard the phone ringing.</p><p>When Jon Bon Jovi heard it ring by his bed, tragic thoughts would have crossed his mind, like any other parent. His daughter Stephanie, who was 19 at the time, was ringing from hospital. She calmly told him she was fine, but explained she was being treated after taking heroin.</p><p>Bon Jovi <a href=# rel=nofollow>admitted</a>: “It was horrible, a horrible moment. It was my worst moment as a father.</p><p>“The first thing she said, ‘I’m alright’, but then she said ‘this is what happened’. You wake up, you shake it off and put your shoes on and say ‘OK, I am on the way home”.</p><p>Cops were called to her dorm at her university, Hamilton College, when Jon Bon Jovi’s daughter was found unconscious. Based in Kirkland, New York, a small amount of heroin was also found in her room at the liberal arts college that had a $55,000 yearly tuition fee at the time.</p><p>Thankfully she recovered, and charges that were set against her and friend Ian Grant, 21, were dropped. This is because of a local law prohibiting prosecuting anyone who has had a drugs overdose.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-terrible-tragic-lesson-of-life>‘A terrible, tragic lesson of life’</h2><p>However, the incident opened the songwriter’s eyes. Jon Bon Jovi said he had no idea his daughter was using drugs.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> confessed: “We went through something that a lot of parents do, many more than I thought. Many more people who have been in my life that I had no idea they had been through it with their own children at one point or another.</p><p>“There’s a lot of pressure on this generation. They have a lot easier access to things than yours or my generation had.”</p><p>He went on to explain she wasn’t ‘using needles’ but there was a lot of “temptation” in the world, with more pressure on the younger generations parents may not understand.</p><p>Bon Jovi said he “wasn’t aware of it”. Not because he traveled with his music career, but because it’s a “different world” out there now.</p><p>Despite the near call, he called the entire situation a “terrible, tragic lesson” of life, but thanks God every day she survived and has her <a href=#>health</a>.</p><p>He added: “It happened and it has gone. I know personally people whose sons and daughters, where it was a lot, lot worse. That could have been Stephanie.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rock-star-knows-nothing-about-that-part-of-the-world>Rock star ‘knows nothing’ about that part of the world</h2><p>Even though he’s one of the legends in the industry, which can sometimes entice rockers to use drugs, drink and smoke themselves, Jon Bon Jovi never “did a thing”, so it was a big shock for his daughter.</p><p>The Livin’ On A Prayer singer admitted: “I didn’t even do anything that could open the cover of the book. I was never attracted to it.”</p><p>And considering the life the celebrity has lived so far, he doesn’t know if he’ll be doing it forever.</p><p>The group has been making music for four decades, and celebrated the anniversary in January.</p><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688 or Talk To Frank on 0300 123 6600 in the UK.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jon-bon-jovi-s-family>Jon Bon Jovi’s family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-946326102-1024x709.jpg><p>Jon Bon Jovi has four children, daughter Stephanie, now 30, and sons Jesse, 29, Jake 21 and Romeo, 19. He shares them with his wife, Dorothea Bongiovi.</p><p>Stephanie, born in 1993, works as a camera operator on <a href=#>TV</a> shows. She was seen with her parents at the MusiCares Person of the Year Gala last month. Her father was honored for his philanthropic work.</p><p>Second-eldest Jesse graduated from the University of Notre Dame where he studied political science and government. He launched a rose company with Jon Bon Jovi, called Hampton Water. It was named the best rose in 2018 by Wine Spectator. Jesse proposed to his girlfriend with the same name, Jesse Light, in 2022.</p><p>Jake Bongiovi is engaged to <a href=#>Netflix</a> star <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown</a>. They had been dating for two years before he dropped down on one knee.</p><p>Youngest, Romeo, appears to stay out of the limelight and off social media. Although he has been seen attending events with his parents, including an event at Kensington Palace in 2013. Bon Jovi was being inducted into the National Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2V%2FcLbOp2Sbp55it7DCyKxksKeiqMFuuc6mnKesXZbAbq2Mn5itoJWneqStzJ5kmp6kmr9uwMSepWackaq0qcDEq2ScmZyhsqV5wK1ka5mdZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjon-bon-jovis-worst-moment-as-a-father-came-after-teen-daughter-called-at-2am.html&text=Jon%20Bon%20Jovi%27s%20%27worst%20moment%20as%20a%20father%27%20came%20after%20teen%20daughter%20called%20at%202am&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjon-bon-jovis-worst-moment-as-a-father-came-after-teen-daughter-called-at-2am.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjon-bon-jovis-worst-moment-as-a-father-came-after-teen-daughter-called-at-2am.html&title=Jon%20Bon%20Jovi%27s%20%27worst%20moment%20as%20a%20father%27%20came%20after%20teen%20daughter%20called%20at%202am" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjon-bon-jovis-worst-moment-as-a-father-came-after-teen-daughter-called-at-2am.html&title=Jon%20Bon%20Jovi%27s%20%27worst%20moment%20as%20a%20father%27%20came%20after%20teen%20daughter%20called%20at%202am" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjon-bon-jovis-worst-moment-as-a-father-came-after-teen-daughter-called-at-2am.html&title=Jon%20Bon%20Jovi%27s%20%27worst%20moment%20as%20a%20father%27%20came%20after%20teen%20daughter%20called%20at%202am" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjon-bon-jovis-worst-moment-as-a-father-came-after-teen-daughter-called-at-2am.html&description=Jon%20Bon%20Jovi%27s%20%27worst%20moment%20as%20a%20father%27%20came%20after%20teen%20daughter%20called%20at%202am" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-middleton-summer-white-heels-7494685.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Middleton Just Wore Summer 2023s Biggest Shoe Trend">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./harrogate-town-fc-15-football-club-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harrogate Town FC: 15 Football Club Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
