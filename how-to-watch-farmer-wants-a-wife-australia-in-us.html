The press release from FOX, who will be airing the US version, describes the premise as: “Four farmers from across the country embark on an adventure of a lifetime in the hopes of finding their future spouse. Women will leave behind dating apps and the pursuit of love in ‘the big city’ in favor of classic American courtship.</p><p>The farmers will take their group of daters to their farm and show them what it is really like to live as ranchers do—from tending to the homestead to feeding cattle and baling hay. For the daters, the realities of this lifestyle may beg the question: how much of your life are you willing to change for love?”</p><p>In Australia, the farmers are located across the country. The synopsis reads: “Five farmers who own land in Australia choose 3-4 women to bring back to live on their farm and date for a short period before they must choose just one to continue dating at the end in hopes to find love.” Natalie Gruzlewski is the show’s current host.</p><p><strong>Farmer Wants a Wife Australia is available to stream in the US with a <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>VPN</a>.
