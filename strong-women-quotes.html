For us, the first person who comes to mind is probably <strong>Beyoncé</strong>. Her music is everywhere, and more importantly than that, she’s a loud advocate for women’s empowerment. In fact, she just became the most awarded singer in Grammys history. But just because Beyoncé is the most prominent example doesn’t mean there aren’t countless other women who inspire us, and they’ve all got something to say.</p><p>From the former first lady&nbsp;<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_michelle-obama data-tag=michelle-obama>Michelle Obama</a>&nbsp;</strong>to pop culture icons such as <strong>Madonna </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Taylor Swift, </strong>they elevate and empower women (and the world) at large.

Women have to work much harder to make it in this world. It really pisses me off that women don’t get the same opportunities as men do, or money for that matter. Because lets face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define our values and to define what’s sexy and what’s feminine and that’s bullshit. At the end of the day, it’s not about equal rights, it’s about how we think. We have to reshape our own perception of how we view ourselves. — <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a></p><p>2. Sit down and ask yourself, ‘What is the most important thing to me?’ What grosses me out the most? What makes me the most upset — is it healthcare? Is it so many people being hungry in our culture? Is it sexual abuse?&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix that with doing something you love, something you could keep doing forever and ever.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">For me</a> it was ending <a href=# id=auto-tag_violence-against-women data-tag=violence-against-women>violence against women</a>, and I mixed it with music. And I’ve had a 25-year career. So that’s my advice: Find something you really care about and mix that with something you love doing.&nbsp;— <strong>Kathleen Hanna</strong></p><p>3. Do not bring people in your life who weigh you down. And trust your instincts … good relationships feel good. They feel right. They don’t hurt. They’re not painful. That’s not just with somebody you want to marry, but it’s with the friends that you choose. It’s with the people you surround yourselves with. —<strong>Michelle Obama</strong></p><p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced.</p></figure></p><p>4. We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced. — <strong>Malala Yousafzai</strong></p><p>5. I would rather be handsome for an hour than pretty for a week. — <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_tilda-swinton data-tag=tilda-swinton>Tilda Swinton</a></strong></p><p>6. Take care of yourself now that you’re old enough to know how. Drink water, sleep eight hours (I wish), and don’t go within 400 feet of a tanning booth or I’ll slap you. Hard. — <strong>Olivia&nbsp;</strong><strong>Wilde</strong></p><p>7. Instead of looking at the past, I put myself ahead twenty years and try to look at what I need to do now in order to get there then –<strong>Diana Ross</strong></p><h2></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/quotes_tilda-swinton.png alt=Quotes_Tilda-Swinton width=578 height=578 sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>8. I’m tough, I’m ambitious, and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, okay. — <strong>Madonna</strong></p><p>9. Take criticism seriously, but not personally. If there is truth or merit in the criticism, try to learn from it. Otherwise, let it roll right off you. — <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><strong><br></strong></p><p>10.When looking for a life partner, my advice to women is date all of them: the bad boys, the cool boys, the commitment-phobic boys, the crazy boys. But do not marry them. The things that make the bad boys sexy do not make them good husbands. When it comes time to settle down, find someone who wants an equal partner. Someone who thinks women should be smart, opinionated and ambitious. Someone who values fairness and expects or, even better, wants to do his share in the home. These men exist and, trust me, over time, nothing is sexier. — <strong>Sheryl&nbsp;</strong><strong>Sandberg</strong></p><p>11. I said, ‘Instead of going in the direction that a lot of the women singers are going in [revealing], I’ll be very, very sexy under 18 pounds of chiffon and lace and velvet…I will have mystique.’ — <strong>Stevie</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Nicks</strong></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>Never be ashamed of how you feel.</p></figure><p>12.I have come to realize making yourself happy is most important.

That’s my life motto. — <a href=# rel=noopener><strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_demi-lovato data-tag=demi-lovato>Demi Lovato</a></strong></a></p><p>13. The girls who were unanimously considered beautiful often rested on their beauty alone. I felt I had to do things, to be intelligent and develop a personality in order to be seen as attractive. By the time I realized maybe I wasn’t plain and might even possibly be pretty, I had already trained myself to be a little more interesting and informed. — <strong>Diane Von Furstenberg</strong></p><p>14.&nbsp;Don’t compromise yourself. You are all you’ve got. There is no yesterday, no tomorrow, it’s all the same day. –<strong>Janis Joplin</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/quotes_madonna.png alt=Quotes_Madonna width=578 height=578 sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>15. I’ll be honest with you. I’m a little bit of a loner. It’s been a big part of my maturing process to learn to allow people to support me. I tend to be very self-reliant and private. And I have this history of wanting to work things out on my own and protect people from what’s going on with me. — <strong>Kerry Washington</strong></p><p>16. Never limit yourself because of others’ limited imagination; never limit others because of your own limited imagination. — <strong>Mae Jemison<br></strong></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>If you want anything done, ask a woman.</p></figure><p>17. In politics, if you want anything said, ask a man; if you want anything done, ask a woman. — <strong>Margaret Thatcher</strong></p><p>18.

If you obey all the rules, you miss all the fun. — <strong>Katharine Hepburn</strong></p><p>23. Everyone has inside of her a piece of good news.

A woman has got to love a bad man once or twice in her life, to be thankful for a good one. — <strong>Marjorie Kinnan</strong></p><p>28.&nbsp;I just love bossy women. I could be around them all day.

You take your life in your own hands, and what happens? A terrible thing: no one to blame. — <strong>Erica Jong<br></strong></p><p>30.

We say to girls: ‘You can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful, but not too successful. Otherwise, you will threaten the man.’ Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage. I am expected to make my life choices, always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important.

With that, you can do anything else. –<strong>Angelina Jolie</strong></p><p>55.&nbsp;I’m a woman, of course I still have curves on me, and that’s ok. I had a baby and I’ve worked hard. And I don’t think women should have to feel that kind of pressure. I’ve done it really healthfully, and I took my time. –<strong>Lily Aldridge</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/quotes_coco-chanel.png alt=Quotes_Coco-Chanel width=578 height=578 sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>56.
