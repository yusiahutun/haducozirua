It had the impact the Duffer Brothers intended, even leaving Joseph scarred. The moment features another brief but important character whom the creators expressed regret at how their storyline had unfolded.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/screencapture-netflix-watch-80229866-2024-01-29-12_11_13-e1706530578397-1024x514.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joseph-quinn-called-one-stranger-things-scene-horrible>Joseph Quinn called one Stranger Things scene ‘horrible’</h2><p>Joseph Quinn called one of the scenes from Stranger Things season four “f****** horrible” after he was called in to do ADR – audio dialogue replacement – which is used to make an actor’s dialogue clear in post-production. He was asked if he’d like to see the scene he was doing it for. But it was so graphic he thought they “wouldn’t get away with it.”</p><p>The scene sees outcast and “freak” Eddie in his home with classmate Crissy Cunningham (Grace Van Dien)) as she becomes possessed by Vecna. Crissy begins to levitate before her four limbs start snapping in various directions and her eyes pop out of their sockets.</p><p>Despite the gruesome nature of her death, the lines of Eddie telling Crissy to wake up and he “doesn’t like this” went viral on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Jason Segel’s most uncomfortable movie scene is based on his real life</a></p><p>The <a href=#>Netflix</a> star told Screenrant of seeing the memorable clip for the first time.</p><p>He said: “I remember in the first session of ADR that I had, they were like, ‘Should we show you the death?’ and I was like, ‘Yeah, sure.’ They showed me and I was like, ‘There’s no way you’re gonna get away with that, Netflix aren’t gonna let you do that.’ But they did and yeah, I think it’s f****** horrible.”</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a> hindsight &nbsp;“can always be a bit of a motherf*****” and said he wished he could’ve worked with Grace more. However, he said he believed her untimely death in the first episode of season four was “necessary” to help set up the plot and tone for the other nine episodes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duffer-brothers-regret-killing-off-chrissy>Duffer Brothers ‘regret’ killing off Chrissy</h2><p>The writers said they had already shot the Stranger Things scene which horrified Joseph Quinn when they got to another that really showed the chemistry between Joseph and Grace.</p><p>“We always have those moments [of ‘What have we&nbsp;done?’],” Matt Duffer said.</p><p>The scene in question sees Chrissy and Eddie talking in the woods on a bench, in which the cheerleader asks the Dungeons and Dragons fan if he can acquire drugs. He seems concerned for his classmate, and doesn’t know why she wants them. “The scene came alive in a way that was just so beautiful. And so much of that was Joe and Grace,” Matt <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> the publication.</p><p>“It was just one of those fortunate scenes where we were able to have two cameras rolling capturing them simultaneously. Joe was doing a lot of stuff kinda spontaneously, and we were getting these amazing reactions from Grace,” he continued.</p><p>He praised Grace for her performance, saying she was “pretty impressive” in getting fans to care about her character so much despite her short stint in the series.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Wizards of Waverly Place actor ‘sad’ as he believes OnlyFans success cut him out of reboot</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eGcL%2FTq5inn5WnerW0yKeerGWapMCmvMdmqK6hnqN6tbTOrp6hrF2jsrWyy6KvZq%2BfqrmledKtnKllmaN6tbuMrKuoqF2dvLO%2ByJujnmWjmLKvsYyfqailXZa2s7XNoGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstranger-things-joseph-quinn-thought-netflix-would-step-in-to-stop-horrible-scene-from-airing.html&text=Stranger%20Things%27%20Joseph%20Quinn%20thought%20Netflix%20would%20step%20in%20to%20stop%20%27horrible%27%20scene%20from%20airing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstranger-things-joseph-quinn-thought-netflix-would-step-in-to-stop-horrible-scene-from-airing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstranger-things-joseph-quinn-thought-netflix-would-step-in-to-stop-horrible-scene-from-airing.html&title=Stranger%20Things%27%20Joseph%20Quinn%20thought%20Netflix%20would%20step%20in%20to%20stop%20%27horrible%27%20scene%20from%20airing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstranger-things-joseph-quinn-thought-netflix-would-step-in-to-stop-horrible-scene-from-airing.html&title=Stranger%20Things%27%20Joseph%20Quinn%20thought%20Netflix%20would%20step%20in%20to%20stop%20%27horrible%27%20scene%20from%20airing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstranger-things-joseph-quinn-thought-netflix-would-step-in-to-stop-horrible-scene-from-airing.html&title=Stranger%20Things%27%20Joseph%20Quinn%20thought%20Netflix%20would%20step%20in%20to%20stop%20%27horrible%27%20scene%20from%20airing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstranger-things-joseph-quinn-thought-netflix-would-step-in-to-stop-horrible-scene-from-airing.html&description=Stranger%20Things%27%20Joseph%20Quinn%20thought%20Netflix%20would%20step%20in%20to%20stop%20%27horrible%27%20scene%20from%20airing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cameron-russell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Cameron Russell dating?
