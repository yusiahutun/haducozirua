fashionable looks</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Suggestions also emerged last night that Home Alone star Catherine O'Hara may also have used Ozempic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>O'Hara has never mentioned using weight loss drugs and previously said she is actually aiming to avoid having work done as she gets older.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 70-year-old told the Hollywood Reporter in

emerging online that she had used weight loss drugs, with a fan posting her name on a Thread about celebrities on Ozempic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Motykie said it was unlikely she was using the drug, however, saying her frame still appeared to be toned.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are concerns over prescribing the drugs to older adults because they can prompt a drop in muscle mass, which may raise the risk of someone suffering from falls and fractures.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But semaglutide is approved for use in adults over the age of 65 years.&nbsp;</p><p
