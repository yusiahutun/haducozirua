But how do you separate the legal ones from the illegal ones?</p><p>It's sometimes blatantly obvious that a site is illegal, especially when they put no effort in concealing it. But what happens when they do put effort? How can you tell the difference between fair use and copyright infringement?</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Here are some easy ways to spot whether a streaming site is illegal and unsafe.</p><h2 id=how-do-legal-streaming-services-get-content>How Do Legal Streaming Services Get Content?</h2><p>Legal streaming services pay to produce or license content. That's why you usually have to pay for these services as well.</p><p>Legal streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video pay for the right to show certain content on their platform. Some of them also have their own production studios, which means they produce original content that hasn't broadcast elsewhere.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Then, they charge you for the right to view that content, usually through a monthly subscription fee, which you can enjoy as much as you want without fear of breaking the law.</p><p>That said, paying is not a sure sign of authenticity. There are <a href=#>great free movie streaming services</a> that are legal, supported through use of advertisements.</p><h2 id=how-to-tell-if-a-streaming-service-is-illegal>How to Tell If a Streaming Service Is Illegal</h2><p>When landing on a <a href=#>site to watch TVs or movies online</a>, be on your guard. Not all streaming sites are legit. Here are the most common ways to determine that you've landed on an illegal site.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=hosts-other-s-original-content>1. Hosts Other's Original Content</h3><p>Legal streaming sites don't poach each other's original content. Amazon has The Man in the High Castle, Disney+ has WandaVision, Netflix has The Witcher, and so on. You won't find any service's original content hosted on another. If you do, you've found yourself on an illegal page, and you'd best leave at once.</p><h3 id=downloadable-content>2. Downloadable Content</h3><p>It's rare for a streaming service to give you the right to download or record its content. While some do provide offline viewing features, you're not actually getting the raw video file to do as you please with.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you get in the realm of finding ways to download that content or replicate it (like recording it while you view it), you're going into the murky waters of piracy. And pirating is illegal. Even if you don't intend to distribute the content you steal, you're still breaking the law. Intent is inconsequential in the eyes of the law.</p><h3 id=questionable-adverts>3. Questionable Adverts</h3><p>As we've established, adverts aren't necessarily a sign that you're on an illegal site, since many free services are supported by them. However, the content and persistency of those ads is usually a strong warning sign.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you've only just opened the site and are already being blasted with ads everywhere you look, it's a cause for concern. Your guard should also be high if these ads are those <a href=#>dodgy clickbait internet ads</a> or are promoting adult content.</p><h3 id=advises-using-a-vpn>4. Advises Using a VPN</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/VPN-laptop-1.jpg><p>It's also not a good sign to see the website urging you to download a VPN as protection. If you get nudged into downloading a VPN, proxies, or whatever else to hide your IP address, it screams trouble, and you'd do best to leave the site.</p><h3 id=literal-warning-signs>5. Literal Warning Signs</h3><p>If the streaming site you've opened has a warning on its landing page, get out of there. No legal site is going to warn you of ramifications arising from being on it. The same applies if you see a disclaimer. There's no need for a legal site to plaster a disclaimer that its content is licensed. If you see one, it's time to leave.</p><h3 id=lack-of-contact-information>6. Lack of Contact Information</h3><p>Another sign you should heed is the lack of available information about the company. More specifically, a missing "About Us" or "Contact Us" page. Legal sites will always have these so that you can verify who you're dealing with.</p><h3 id=doesn-t-have-an-app>7. Doesn't Have an App</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/netflix-app.jpg><p>Most streaming services will offer a companion app. Many of us consume content on-the-go, so it makes sense, and it's hard to find a service without one.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Not having an app isn't the be-all and end-all of establishing legality. But an app does add credence to a streaming service's legality, since otherwise it would likely be pulled from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Free Movie Apps to Watch Movies Online</a></span></p><h2 id=the-consequences-of-copyright-infringement>The Consequences of Copyright Infringement</h2><p>Do you know about copyright? It's important. Put simply, copyright protects original work. If you make something original, others aren't allowed to copy, republish, or distribute it without your permission. If they do, they suffer consequences.</p><p>Breaking copyright law has legal ramifications. Depending on the severity, you can get fined or even imprisoned. But paying a fine or landing in jail aren't the only consequences you face when pirating.</p><p>Browsing an illegal streaming site poses security risks. You can end up downloading malware to your device and not even realize it at the time. Countless cyber threats lurk online and an illegal site is a hot spot for them. You might think you're clicking to watch a movie or download the latest season of a show, but you could be paving the way for a nasty cyber infection straight to your device.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Using Illegal IPTV Streams Is a Bad Idea</a></span></p><p>Not to mention the repercussions that follow if you provide any personal or payment information. You might find yourself the victim of identity theft. Is watching the latest episode of The Falcon and The Winter Soldier without paying really worth all that trouble?</p><h2 id=it-s-better-to-be-safe-than-sorry>It's Better to Be Safe Than Sorry</h2><p>While it can get expensive to pay for every streaming service out there, that's not an excuse to resort to illegal means or to risk your security. Paying is far better than taking all the risks mentioned above. It's better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>Using legit services like HBO Max, Paramount+, and Netflix ensures you're not breaking any laws, and you don't face any security issues. They're safe and reliable.</p><p>If you can't afford to pay all these streaming services to watch their movies and shows legally, there are other things you can do instead of turning to illegal sites.</p><p>Many platforms offer free trials you can use to your advantage. There are also family plans you can split with relatives, friends, and roommates. Make sure to explore all your options and avoid turning to piracy.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGigrGWRYsC1vsSapKKml2LApr7VopqeZZyatKK4jKyYn51f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-a-streaming-service-legal-safe.html&text=How%20to%20Tell%20If%20a%20Streaming%20Service%20Is%20Legal%20and%20Safe&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-a-streaming-service-legal-safe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-a-streaming-service-legal-safe.html&title=How%20to%20Tell%20If%20a%20Streaming%20Service%20Is%20Legal%20and%20Safe" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-a-streaming-service-legal-safe.html&title=How%20to%20Tell%20If%20a%20Streaming%20Service%20Is%20Legal%20and%20Safe" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-a-streaming-service-legal-safe.html&title=How%20to%20Tell%20If%20a%20Streaming%20Service%20Is%20Legal%20and%20Safe" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-a-streaming-service-legal-safe.html&description=How%20to%20Tell%20If%20a%20Streaming%20Service%20Is%20Legal%20and%20Safe" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mark-wahlberg-and-traci-bingham.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark Wahlberg and Traci Bingham">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pilar-sanders.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Pilar Sanders dating?
