"Are you serious? Help me? Sorry—is that what you call this? Helping me?" Harry recalls asking his brother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The comment enraged William, Harry says. Attempting to deescalate, Harry offered William a glass of water, saying, "Willy, I can't speak to you when you're like this."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He set down the water, called me another name, then came at me. It all happened so fast. So very fast," Harry writes. "He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor. I landed on the dog's bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">William urged Harry to hit him back, citing the fights they used to have as children, but Harry refused. William left the house but returned "looking regretful, and apologised," Harry writes, recalling that William then told him, "You don't need to tell Meg about this."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You mean that you attacked me?" Harry said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I didn't attack you, Harold," William replied.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>2 | He lost his virginity to an "older lady."</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Duke of Sussex included a highly personal anecdote in his memoir: the moment he had sex for the first time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry says he lost his virginity to an "older lady" who "loved horses very much." The moment, he says, was "a humiliating episode" that took place "in a field."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I mounted her quickly, after which she spanked my ass and held me back … one of my mistakes was letting it happen in a field, just behind a busy pub," he writes."No doubt someone had seen us."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-12zwj0s emevuu60"><strong>3 | Kate made Meghan cry over Princess Charlotte's flower girl dress.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a42417013/prince-harry-kate-middleton-made-meghan-markle-cry-spare-memoir/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="alleged disagreement" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">alleged disagreement</a> that took place between Duchess Meghan and Catherine, Princess of Wales, has been widely scrutinized since Meghan <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a35744920/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-cry-oprah-harry/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="refuted a tabloid story" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">refuted a tabloid story</a> that claimed she made Kate cry in the days leading up to her 2018 nuptials to Harry. In a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan insisted that "the reverse happened." Now, Spare offers more insight into the dispute.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11602431/Meghan-offended-reprimanded-insulting-Kate.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Daily Mail" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Daily Mail</a> initially reported that Meghan offended Kate during a phone call in which she said the senior royal, who recently gave birth, had "baby brain." Meghan apologized for the comment, per Harry's memoir, but William "pointed a finger" at her in anger. "Well, it's rude, Meghan. These things are not done here," William allegedly told her, to which she responded, "Kindly take your finger out of my face."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Harry, during the week of Harry and Meghan's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a42252492/prince-harry-meghan-markle-new-details-wedding-photos-docuseries/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2018 nuptials" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2018 nuptials</a>, Kate texted Meghan about a "problem" with Princess Charlotte's flower girl dress (he even included the alleged <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a42443931/prince-harry-text-kate-middleton-meghan-markle-spare/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="actual text from the messages" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">actual text from the messages</a> in the book). She said Charlotte's dress was "too big, too long, too baggy," and that the little royal "cried when she tried it on." Meghan told Kate that a tailor on standby at the palace could perform the necessary alterations to Charlotte's dress, but Kate told the bride-to-be that all the bridesmaid dresses needed to be completely remade, with just four days left before the wedding. Harry shares that Kate then cited the advice of her own wedding dress designer, Alexander McQueen's Sarah Burton, who agreed that the dresses had to be redone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate ultimately agreed to take Charlotte to the tailor, but Harry writes that he later found his soon-to-be-wife in tears "on the floor" following their argument. The duke also shares that Kate apologized the next day with flowers and a card.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>4 | William and Kate encouraged Harry to wear his infamous Nazi costume.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry recalls debating between <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a42407385/prince-harry-william-kate-middleton-told-him-wear-nazi-halloween-costume/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dressing as a Nazi" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">dressing as a Nazi</a> or a pilot for a "Native and Colonial"–themed costume party in 2005. He allegedly sought advice from his older brother and sister-in-law.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I phoned Willy and Kate, asked what they thought. Nazi uniform, they said," Harry writes, saying he then tried the costume on in front of them. "They both howled. Worse than Willy's leotard outfit! Way more ridiculous! Which, again, was the point."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry went with the Nazi look, and soon after, a photo of him partying in a white military shirt and red swastika armband made headlines in the British newspapers and around the world. The incident came two weeks before the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>5 | Harry and William urged Charles not to marry Camilla.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The royal brothers allegedly told their father, King Charles III, to not marry Camilla, now queen consort.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Despite Willy and me urging him not to, Pa was going ahead. We pumped his hand, wished him well. No hard feelings," Harry writes. "We recognized that he was finally going to be with the woman he loved, the woman he'd always loved. Fate might've intended for him in the first place. Whatever bitterness or sorrow we felt over the closing of another loop in Mummy's story, we understood that it was besides the point."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He also reflects on his complicated relationship with his stepmother. "I remember wondering … if she would be cruel to me; if she would be like all the evil stepmothers in the stories," he writes. "Willy had been suspicious of the Other Woman for a long time, which confused and tormented him. When those suspicions were confirmed, he felt agonizing remorse for not having done or said anything before."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Charles and Camilla officially wed on April 9, 2005. Following their union, it was announced that Camilla would not go by the Princess of Wales, the title famously held by Princess Diana.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>6 | Harry re-created Princess Diana's final moments.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In one heartbreaking passage, the Duke of Sussex recalls <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a42407501/prince-harry-spare-memoir-princess-diana-paris-tunnel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="driving through the same tunnel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">driving through the same tunnel</a> in Paris where Diana got into a fatal car crash in 1997. At the time, Harry was 23 years old and attending the 2007 Rugby World Cup semifinal in Paris.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The World Cup provided me with a driver, and on my first night in the City of Light I asked him if he knew the tunnel where my mother … I watched his eyes in the rearview, growing large. The tunnel is called Pont de l'Alma, I told him," he writes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry says he requested the driver go through the tunnel at 65 miles per hour, "The exact speed Mummy's car had supposedly been driving, according to police, at the time of the crash. Not 120 miles per hour, as the press originally reported."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once they passed through the tunnel, Harry recalls, "We zipped ahead, went over the lip at the tunnel's entrance, the bump that supposedly sent Mummy's Mercedes veering off course. But the lip was nothing. We barely felt it. As the car entered the tunnel I leaned forward, watched the light change to a kind of water orange, watched the concrete pillars flicker past. I counted them, counted my heartbeats, and in a few seconds we emerged from the other side. I sat back. Quietly I said: Is that all of it? It's … nothing. Just a straight tunnel. I'd always imagined the tunnel as some treacherous passageway, inherently dangerous, but it was just a short, simple, no-frills tunnel. No reason anyone should ever die inside it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He concludes that re-creating her final journey did little to alleviate him from his grief. "It had been a very bad idea. I'd had plenty of bad ideas in my twenty-three years, but this one was uniquely ill-conceived," he writes. "I'd told myself that I wanted closure, but I didn't really. Deep down, I'd hoped to feel in that tunnel what I'd felt when JLP gave me the police files—disbelief. Doubt. Instead, that was the night all doubt fell away. She's dead, I thought. My God, she's really gone for good."</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>7 | Harry spoke with a medium to contact his mother in the afterlife.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry writes in his memoir that he sought the help of a woman who "claimed to have powers" that can relay messages from people who have passed on, including his mother, the late Princess Diana.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You're living the life she couldn't. You're living the life she wanted for you," said the woman, whom Harry does not refer to as a psychic or medium. The woman also told Harry that Diana was with him "right now," a message that made his neck grow warm and his eyes water.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The woman reportedly said that Diana was with the family when his and Meghan's toddler son, Archie, broke a Christmas tree ornament in the shape of Queen Elizabeth II. "Your mother says … something about a Christmas ornament? Of a mother? Or a grandmother? It fell? Broke?" Harry recalls the woman saying. "Your mother says she had a bit of a giggle about that."<br></p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>8 | He reveals his headcount.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry writes in Spare that he killed 25 people while he was stationed in Afghanistan during his service for the British Army.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Most soldiers don't know exactly how many kills they have to their credit. Under battle conditions, you often fire indiscriminately," he writes. "However, in the age of Apaches and laptops, everything I did in the course of two tours of duty was recorded and time-stamped. I could always tell exactly how many enemy combatants I had killed. And it seemed essential for me not to be afraid of that figure. Among the many things I learned in the Armed Forces, one of the most important was to be accountable for my own actions."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Duke of Sussex spent 10 years in the army and went on two frontline tours to Afghanistan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He continues, "So my number: twenty-five. It was not something that filled me with satisfaction, but I was not ashamed either. Naturally, I would have preferred not to have that figure on my military resume, or in my head, but I would also have preferred to live in a world without the Taliban, a world without war. However, even for a casual practitioner of wishful thinking like myself, there are realities that cannot be changed."</p><h2 data-node-id=48 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>9 | He recalls his last words to Queen Elizabeth II.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry flew straight from London to Balmoral Castle, in Scotland, with King Charles III and Prince William when they heard Queen Elizabeth was ill on September 8, but he still didn't make it in time to say goodbye to his grandmother before <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a38038396/queen-elizabeth-ii-died-age-96/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="her death" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">her death</a>. When he got to see her some hours later, he writes in his memoir, that he whispered that he "hoped she would be happy" and that she would be with his grandfather, Prince Philip, soon. (Philip died on April 9, 2021, at the age of 99, and the queen died on September 8, 2022, at 96.) He also told the queen—Britain's longest-reigning monarch—that he "admired her for having fulfilled her duties until the very end."<strong><br></strong></p><h2 data-node-id=50 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>10 | William wasn't his best man.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The royal writes in Spare hat he didn't actually choose older brother Prince William to be his best man at his wedding to Meghan Markle, as Buckingham Palace initially claimed. Harry writes that he instead chose his "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a42444169/prince-harry-says-didnt-choose-prince-william-best-man-spare/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="old mate Charlie" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">old mate Charlie</a>" to fulfill the best man duties.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The night before his and Meghan's wedding, Harry claims that William "canceled last minute" on plans to get drinks with him and his friends. "He'd told me, just before he attended tea with Granny: Can't do it, Harold. Kate and the kids," Harry writes. "I'd reminded him that this was our tradition, that we'd had dinner before his wedding, that we'd gone together and visited the crowds. He held fast. Can't do it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He continued, "I asked myself what was really going on. Was he feeling bad about not being my best man? Was he upset that I'd asked my old mate Charlie? (The Palace put out the story that Willy was the best man, as they'd done with me when he and Kate married.) Could that be part of it?" Harry adds that William also didn't choose him to be his best man for his wedding to Kate.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=54 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>11 | Harry thought Princess Diana was "hiding" after her death.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The prince found his mother's untimely passing too difficult to accept, so difficult, in fact, that for a while he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a42432776/prince-harry-princess-diana-went-into-hiding-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="completely denied it" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">completely denied it</a> to himself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry writes in his memoir, "With nothing to do but roam the castle and talk to myself, a suspicion took hold, which then became a firm belief. This was all a trick. And for once the trick wasn't being played by the people around me, or the press, but by Mummy. Her life's been miserable, she's been hounded, harassed, lied about, lied to. So she's staged an accident as a diversion and run away."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
