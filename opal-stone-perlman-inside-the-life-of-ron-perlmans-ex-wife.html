She rose to fame after tying the knot with American actor Ron Perlman. Her then-husband, Ron, is a renowned actor best known for playing Amoukar in “Quest for Fire” and Vincent in the television series “Beauty and the Beast,” for which he won a Golden Globe Award.</p><p>In addition, Ron appeared in other movies, including “Hellboy” and “The Name of the Rose.”&nbsp;Before her marriage to the famous actor, Stone led a private life. However, their marriage propelled her to stardom. Their union was blissful, and the couple was together for almost four decades before they split in 2019.</p><p>Like her ex-husband, Stone has made a name for herself. She is one of the best designers in the American fashion industry. Here’s a look into her life, career, marriage, and subsequent divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-11_05-43-40-fotor-202310116258.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Opal_Stone_Perlman></span>How Old Is Opal Stone Perlman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Opal Stone Perlman is 72 years old. The renowned fashion designer was born in Montego Bay, Jamaica, on August 8, 1951. While most details about her early life remain private, Stone grew up with her parents. According to reports, Stone’s mother was a dressmaker, and her father was an entrepreneur.</p><p>However, the former celebrity spouse has not revealed their identities. Also, reports suggest she has two sisters, Sharon and Janice.&nbsp;While Stone is of Black ethnicity, her ex-husband is of White Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Like most details about her early life, her middle and high school years also elude the media.</p><p>After graduating high school, Stone studied psychology in college. However, influenced by her mother’s career, she dropped out of the program to join the Parsons School of Design in New York City, USA.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Opal_Stone_Perlman_Start_Her_Career></span>When Did Opal Stone Perlman Start Her Career?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Opal Stone Perlman grew up with a passion for design. However, she ventured into the fashion industry after completing her education in the United States of America. With an unyielding dedication and sourcing the best design materials, Stone has established a highly successful path as a jewelry and fashion designer.&nbsp;</p><p>The former celebrity spouse owns a jewelry line called Opal Stone Fine Jewellery. Stone’s jewelry line features an array of high-end accessories such as bangles, earrings, cuffs, rings, and necklaces. She produces jewelry designs from various materials, including pearls, gold, silver, and diamond.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Ron Perlman’s ex-wife owns a luxury handbag line. Her luxury handbag line has catered to top celebrities like Beyonce, Selma Blair, Kelly Osborne, Jennifer Hudson, and Teri Hutcher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-11_05-43-59-fotor-202310116230.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Ron_Perlman_Meet_His_First_Wife></span>When Did Ron Perlman Meet His First Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ron Perlman met Opal Stone Perlman in 1976 in a local store where he worked. According to Ron, her beauty immediately captivated him, and he made a kind gesture to assist her. Shortly after she finished shopping, Stone asked Ron if he was hiring. Although Ron had no power to hire anyone in the store, the “Hellboy” star quickly asked if she could start soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Ron realized that he acted on the spur of the moment after Stone agreed to resume the next day. Nevertheless, the “Sons of Anarchy” actor couldn’t wait to see the stunning beauty again.&nbsp;</p><p>Stone’s first day at the store was one of the happiest days of his life. The duo spent hours chatting and bonding. Finally, after four months of working together, Ron mustered up the courage to ask her out on a date.&nbsp;</p><p>The lovebirds had their first date on Valentine’s Day that same year, and Ron knew he was in love. Consequently, three months after their first date, the couple moved in together and continued building their bond.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Opal_Stone_Perlman_Tie_the_Knot></span>When Did Opal Stone Perlman Tie the Knot?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A short time before their first Valentine’s Day date anniversary, Ron popped the big question. The sudden proposal surprised Stone, who wondered how they would pull off a wedding on such short notice. However, Ron was bent on having a Valentine’s Day wedding.</p><p>Consequently, Ron Perlman and Opal Stone Perlman had a simple wedding on February 14, 1981. The couple had Ron’s best friend, Burton, and Stone’s sisters, Sharon and Janice, in attendance. Although the event was far from glamorous, the famous actor had his dream of tying the knot on Valentine’s Day.</p><p>During their almost four decades-long marriage, the couple welcomed two children. Their first child, a daughter, Blake Perlman, was born in 1984. Afterward, the then-couple welcomed a son, Brandon Avery, born in 1990. While Blake is an actress, Brandon is a musician. He produced electronic music under the stage name Delroy Edwards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-11_05-43-46-fotor-2023101162331.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Ron_Perlman_and_His_First_Wife_Divorce></span>When Did Ron Perlman and His First Wife Divorce?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After thirty-eight years of marriage, <a href=#>Ron Perlman</a> filed for divorce in November 2019. Eight months later, Opal Stone Perlman responded by filing for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. The renowned designer claimed spousal support and attorney fees in her response.</p><p>The couple finalized their divorce in October 2021, and the court ordered Ron to pay his ex-wife $12,500 a month in perpetuity. In addition, the famous actor will also pay 20% of his gross income earned annually over $624,000 up to a max of $1.5 million to her.</p><p>Following their divorce, Ron remarried actress <a href=#>Allison Dunbar</a> in June 2022. However, Opal Stone Perlman is single. Like Hugh Hefner’s first wife, <a href=#>Millie Williams</a>, the fashion designer lives in luxury away from the limelight.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kvLGty2aqraeemnqxsdGlpJqmXZ67tLXDnmStoJViuaqyxGamn2WipLtuvMSro6aZnqh6psSMsKCfnV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fopal-stone-perlman-inside-the-life-of-ron-perlmans-ex-wife.html&text=Opal%20Stone%20Perlman%3a%20Inside%20the%20Life%20of%20Ron%20Perlman%27s%20Ex-Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fopal-stone-perlman-inside-the-life-of-ron-perlmans-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fopal-stone-perlman-inside-the-life-of-ron-perlmans-ex-wife.html&title=Opal%20Stone%20Perlman%3a%20Inside%20the%20Life%20of%20Ron%20Perlman%27s%20Ex-Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fopal-stone-perlman-inside-the-life-of-ron-perlmans-ex-wife.html&title=Opal%20Stone%20Perlman%3a%20Inside%20the%20Life%20of%20Ron%20Perlman%27s%20Ex-Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fopal-stone-perlman-inside-the-life-of-ron-perlmans-ex-wife.html&title=Opal%20Stone%20Perlman%3a%20Inside%20the%20Life%20of%20Ron%20Perlman%27s%20Ex-Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fopal-stone-perlman-inside-the-life-of-ron-perlmans-ex-wife.html&description=Opal%20Stone%20Perlman%3a%20Inside%20the%20Life%20of%20Ron%20Perlman%27s%20Ex-Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./best-ballet-sneakers-to-shop-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 11 best 'Ballet sneakers' to shop now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./miley-cyrus-outfit-changes-2024-grammy-awards.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Miley Cyrus' 5 unforgettable Grammys looks: The naked dress, glittering Gucci gown, more">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
