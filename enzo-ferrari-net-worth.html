Born on February 20, 1898, in Modena, Italy; he started his racing career as a driver for CMN (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali) in 1919. &nbsp;</p><p>His story serves as the basis for the biopic Ferrari, starring <a href=#>Adam Driver as the brand’s eponymous entrepreneur</a>. “During the summer of 1957, bankruptcy looms over the company that Enzo Ferrari and his wife built 10 years earlier. He decides to roll the dice and wager it all on the iconic Mille Miglia, a treacherous 1,000-mile race across Italy,” as the synopsis of the film goes.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DVFxtargetreview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question4_FI.jpg><p>“The decision I made that Adam should be Enzo came from having drinks at Chateau Marmont in Sunset Boulevard,” Mann tells the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Inside Total Film podcast</a>. “There was something about how he’s lived life. He has a raw ambition, an artistic ambition, and real ferocity behind that drive to really do this work, do it really well, and really get it. You see it all over, it’s a transformational performance in how he moves, how he walks, the weight, how he breathes.”</p><p>He added: “The way he captured all the cultural gestures, it’s all intentional, there is no, ‘I’ll just show up and be spontaneous.’ This is all preparation, and it’s all work. I think I sensed that ferocity is based on real-life, real-world experience, and I thought this guy is Enzo Ferrari on the inside. The outside, you fix with craftwork – it’s what’s on the inside.”</p><p>With all that said, here’s what we know about Enzo Ferrari’s net worth and who inherited his fortune upon his death on August 14, 1988, at the age of 90.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=enzo-ferrari-s-net-worth>Enzo Ferrari’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-72277705.jpg><p>Enzo Ferrari’s net worth is difficult to pin down, despite founding the company with a market cap of $83.61 billion at the time of publishing. Celebrity Net Wort <a rel=nofollow href=#>estimates his fortune was around $50 million</a> at the time of his death, but states that Enzo was never “rich” during his lifetime, with the business always operating at a loss to fund his beloved racing team.</p><p>“I’ve been involved in racing since 1919, and to go on living a human being must always have new ambitions. At Ferrari <a rel=nofollow href=#>the most beautiful victory</a> is always the next one,” he told Autosport in 1986. “Racing,” he told The Times of London a few years before his death “is a great mania to which one must sacrifice everything, without reticence, without hesitation.”</p><p>In his seemingly out-of-print autobiography, My Terrible Joys, Enzo wrote “I have yet to meet anyone quite so stubborn as myself and animated by this overpowering passion that leaves me no time for thought or anything else. I have, in fact, no interest in life outside racing cars,” he wrote. “I have never gone on a real trip, never taken a holiday. The best holiday for me is spent in my workshops when nearly everybody else is on vacation.”</p><p>Things got so dire financially that, in 1969, he told 50 percent of the company to Fiat, which was controlled by the Agnelli family, for $11 million. The remaining 10 percent share was inherited by his only surviving son, Piero, who was born to Enzo’s mistress, Lina Lardi, in 1945. In 2015, Ferrari went public and Piero’s stake was valued at around $2 billion. In 2023, he’s estimated to be worth around $7.2 billion.</p><p>“The <a rel=nofollow href=#>size of the company now is very different</a>, it would be difficult for him to imagine, but the DNA of Ferrari from my father’s time is still there, every employee is proud to work for Ferrari,” Piero told The Guardian in 2020. “I hope there will be another 1,000 to come. I will not be there to see it but I hope my grandchildren will. There has never been the question of do we race next year or not? Never. We are competing in F1 we have always been there. It is not a question. It is a fact. We are in F1 and we will continue.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MCDFERR_EC026.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-did-enzo-ferrari-die>How did Enzo Ferrari die?</h2><p>As mentioned, Enzo Ferrari died aged 90 on August 14, 1988, of leukemia. Because he was a private person, Enzo expressed the wish for his death to be reported in the media only on 16 August, the day after his burial (witnessed only by his family) on 15 August.</p><p>“He was not an engineer or a manufacturer, but a great impresario,” said David E. Davis, editor and publisher of Automobile magazine in the New York Times obituary. “Ferrari was always surrounded by great designers and craftsmen, but it was <a rel=nofollow href=#>his passion that created the cars</a>.”</p><p>Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita described Ferrari as “the great Italian symbol of youth, audacity, tenacity and technical progress,” per the Washington Post, adding that “the country that has loved him for all this that he represented will continue to love him in the red cars that will still race with his name.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png><p>As the book that inspired the film, <a data-pmc-sp-product=2daad6f429a1a898ae77f5be5de3a984 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Enzo Ferrari","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Enzo Ferrari (Movie Tie-in Edition): The Man and the Machine","price":"13.99","id":"B0CJDRQR6K","category":"Biographies & Memoirs"},"id":1687179,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Enzo Ferrari</a> &nbsp;is the impressively researched, fully detailed biography of one of the most powerful men of the twentieth century.

Fast, fun, and scandalous,&nbsp;Enzo Ferrari&nbsp;more than lives up to its remarkable subject.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
