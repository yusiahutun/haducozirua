They’re bargain braggers at their finest, and I for one, love watching people <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a> and call out their favorite beauty products that rival the more expensive brands. Since the beauty section at Target has skyrocketed in popularity, it only makes sense that the store is adding even more brands to its roster in the new year.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>Starting off strong in 2024, Target has already revealed massive launch news within the beauty and wellness space, including Hum, Raw Sugar, and much more.
