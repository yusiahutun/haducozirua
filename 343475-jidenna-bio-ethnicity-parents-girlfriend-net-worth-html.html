He was instrumental in setting up the Anambra State University of Technology. After living in his home country for six years, his father moved back to the USA together with his young family.</p><p class=align-left>His family, specifically his dad was keen on academics. Jidenna, through his 2019 album, has made many references about his dad’s views on education and life. His father’s impact, together with his good grades, helped him to secure a spot at Stanford University.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> What you didn't know about Dua Lipa's ethnicity</p><p class=align-left>While Jidenna’s nationality is American, he still considers himself as an Igbo, which is a Nigerian tribe.

Although the world knows little about Jidenna’s parents, they meet in the USA while pursuing education. Unfortunately, his father <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">died in 2010</a> in Norwood, Massachusetts.</p><p class=align-left>Jidenna mother – Tama Mobisson – lives in the USA. Apart from being an instrumental figure in her son’s career, Tama is part of Lifeline for Biafra, which is a humanitarian organisation in Nigeria. Tama co-founded the organisation with her late husband to help people to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the region.</p><p class=align-left>The rapper is single. Earlier in 2016, tabloids published stories linking Rosalyn Gold-Onwude to the musician. Due to their closeness, people believed that the basketball pundit was Jidenna’s girlfriend. However, in a 2019 tweet, the rapper hinted that he is still single.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Jidenna has always loved music since he was nine years. However, unlike many artists in the pop industry, he took a different route. The following are some of his career highlights, from a teacher to a musician to a social activist.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0f3c4e2b7f347a1c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mesach Semakula biography: wife, house, cars, songs, life story</span></p></a><h3>Jidenna as a full-time teacher in Los Angeles</h3><p class=align-left>After graduating in 2008, the artist got a job as a full-time teacher.

However, his most significant collaboration under the record label is his project with Janelle Monáe. Working with Janelle Monáe in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">writing and producing Yoga</a> was an essential springboard toward his commercial success in the music industry.</p><h3>Jidenna's projects with other composers, singers, and artists</h3><p class=align-left>Although he has only released two albums, Jidenna has one of the best discographies in rap music. In his two albums, he has worked with the best songwriters, producers, and artists.

However, in the past four years, he has successfully sold his two albums on all streaming platforms. He has also performed in different countries around the world.</p><p class=align-left>Thanks to different revenue streams, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth estimates</a> Jidenna net worth to be $1 Million. Also, due to the early success of his new album, his net worth might go up in the next two few years. The following are some of his revenue streams in the past four years.</p><h3>Performance fees</h3><p class=align-left>Jidenna is a performing artist, and performances constitute a significant percentage of his earnings. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to CTI</a> (Celebrity Talent International), his performance fees range from $40,000 to $74,999 for a show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/edcf920b38609087.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mbosso bio: real name, wife, parents, house, cars, latest songs</span></p></a><h3>Endorsements</h3><p class=align-left>With close to two million followers on all social media platforms, he fits the definition of a celebrity influencer.
