Goodness, the pair of them must have had some vicious run-ins.</p><p>Hall's letters, contained in a dog-eared marbled letterbook in which he kept copies of the correspondence he sent, mostly to his superiors, emerged recently in an auction at Bonhams, where they were sold for £4,000 to the Wellcome Trust.</p><p>But how much do they reflect the truth?</p><p>And to what extent might they simply be the bitter spleen-venting of a 19th century man enraged by the intrusion of a strong-willed woman into his world?</p><p>"There was a culture clash," says Richard Aspin, head of the Wellcome Trust's archive and manuscripts.</p><p>"Hall's background was the rumbustious, maledominated world of Wellington's army; whereas in her you get Victorian upper-middle-class morality.</p><p>But Hall's letters are quite witty, and ironic - he was no fool.'</p><p>Aspin continues: "One of the interesting things these letters reveal is that Florence Nightingale didn't really play by the rules.</p><p>"She didn't play fair and she didn't go through the normal channels.</p><p>"If she wanted something, she set about getting it in whatever way she could and I think that really rankled.</p><p>"She was a formidable personality and I think the male medical establishment really had no idea of what it was up against."</p><p>Certainly, only someone with an iron will would have been equal to the task Florence Nightingale set herself.</p><p>Shortly after British and French troops landed in the Crimea in September 1854, graphic reports of the horrific conditions in which the injured found themselves began to filter home.</p><p>Women were asked to volunteer their services as nurses and Nightingale offered with alacrity to leave for Turkey.</p><p>She was already searching for a more challenging position.</p><p>Having completed a full nurse's training, she had been made superintendent of the Institution for the Care of Sick Gentlewomen in London, but felt her talents were being wasted and had begun to refer to it dismissively as "this little molehill."</p><p>The Crimean War, in which British and French troops were fighting the Russians, was no molehill.</p><p>Nightingale arrived in Scutari in the Crimea on November 5, 1854, with a party of 38 volunteers and a brief from her close friend, the then war secretary Sidney Herbert to take complete charge of the Barrack Hospital there.</p><p>Conditions were appalling: there were vermin and fleas and the rotting corpse of a Russian army officer in her living quarters when she arrived.</p><p>The hospital was desperately overcrowded and poor sanitation meant the place was filthy.</p><p>Surgeons worked by candlelight on bodies whose blood gushed onto the straw that covered the floor; rats chewed at the bodies even of those still living and the revolting stench of decomposing flesh infiltrated everything.</p><p>With great determination, Nightingale set about imposing her own reforms: scrubbing brushes were ordered in to clean the wards, patients' clothes were sent out to be washed and she insisted that no woman but her should patrol the patients' beds after 8pm.</p><p>A large contingent of support back home in parliament and slavishly devoted coverage of her efforts by the Times newspaper's Scutari correspondent, W.H. Stowe, infuriated Sir John Hall as her star rose at his expense.</p><p>Hall was all too aware of the widespread belief following Stowe's reports that 'Florence Nightingale arrived and order out of chaos sprung'.</p><p>So perhaps it is no wonder his letters dismiss the Times's correspondent as a "miserable penny-a-line youth," and warned that, "If not resisted [Nightingale] will, with the influence she has at home throw us completely into the shade in future, as we are at present overlooked in everything that is good and beneficial regarding our hospital arrangements, which are ascribed utterly to her presiding genius by a great part of the press and her own itinerant eulogistic orators."</p><p>His retaliation amounted to a no-holds-barred denunciation of Nightingale.</p><p>To Hall, she was nakedly ambitious, serving not her country but her meddling ego.</p><p>He was angry about the way she intervened to sack nurses and orderlies for drinking too much or for being too slatternly, which he regarded as a villainous waste of precious human resources.</p><p>And he was thrilled when there was a revolt among some of those who worked for her.</p><p>Writing to his superior, Dr Andrew Smith, in London on April 6, 1856, he explained that he had replaced some orderlies with Medical Staff Corps men, "and Miss Nightingale accompanied the nurses to establish them, and perhaps to enjoy exercising personal control over [them]. . . but in that she was disappointed, for they declined to serve under her orders."</p><p>What seems to have outraged Hall more than anything, though, was the authority with which Nightingale went over his head to order in supplies - "for whatever she thought proper, without any reference whatsoever to the Medical authorities."</p><p>This was not something he was prepared to let go: "I have declined sanctioning [them]," he continues, "and shall contrive to do so until positively ordered to the contrary.</p><p>"Such demands are not required for the sick and are most mischievous in principle. Where are they to end?"</p><p>He took particular exception to an order Miss Nightingale had placed for "500 dozen of Port Wine, 300 dozen of Essence of Beef and other articles."</p><p>These were unnecessary extravagances, he asserted.</p><p>As Aspin of the Wellcome Trust points out: "Here we have as close as we're ever going to get to the real raw, inner feelings of a proud man whose world was turned upside down by a female interloper."</p><p>Hall's papers will be held by the Wellcome library, and available for the public to look at. They are not the only Florence Nightingale artefacts there.</p><p>The Trust's founder was a supporter of Florence Nightingale - hers was the only woman's name he felt merited inclusion in his library - which is why it also owns the only known recording of Florence Nightingale's voice in which she calls for support for the Light Brigade Relief fund, as well as a pair of the moccasins the Lady of the Lamp wore at Scutari.</p><p>As to whether she was a virtuous woman following a natural vocation or scheming egotist who abused her prominence, history must still decide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKBeIWWcmlohJWpwaa%2B0mapnq6VlrluutSrqp5ldqG8s7HNnJxmhpmctbW1zaCYpZ1doq66rsRmqqKmnpq%2Fbr%2FAoqWtZpipuq0%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fletters-reveal-nurse-florence-nightingale-maybe-sinner-saint-html.html&text=Letters%20reveal%20nurse%20Florence%20Nightingale%20was%20maybe%20more%20of%20a%20sinner%20than%20a%20saint&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fletters-reveal-nurse-florence-nightingale-maybe-sinner-saint-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fletters-reveal-nurse-florence-nightingale-maybe-sinner-saint-html.html&title=Letters%20reveal%20nurse%20Florence%20Nightingale%20was%20maybe%20more%20of%20a%20sinner%20than%20a%20saint" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fletters-reveal-nurse-florence-nightingale-maybe-sinner-saint-html.html&title=Letters%20reveal%20nurse%20Florence%20Nightingale%20was%20maybe%20more%20of%20a%20sinner%20than%20a%20saint" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fletters-reveal-nurse-florence-nightingale-maybe-sinner-saint-html.html&title=Letters%20reveal%20nurse%20Florence%20Nightingale%20was%20maybe%20more%20of%20a%20sinner%20than%20a%20saint" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fletters-reveal-nurse-florence-nightingale-maybe-sinner-saint-html.html&description=Letters%20reveal%20nurse%20Florence%20Nightingale%20was%20maybe%20more%20of%20a%20sinner%20than%20a%20saint" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./reformation-shoes-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reformation Launches Shoe Collection - Reformation Sandals">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bret-michaels-engaged-kristi-gibson-proposal-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bret Michaels &amp;amp; Kristi Are Engaged!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
