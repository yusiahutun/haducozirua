Of course, she did not get to this point in her career without breaking a sweat. Her political beginnings were not easy, and her accent to the big league was also marred with great controversy.</p><p class=align-left>Nonetheless, it seems that her wealth is growing every year. Maxine Waters' net worth before and after being elected is quite diverse. She has probably matured with age, learning the game, and making the right business moves. Her influential political career has also given her an upper hand in growing her wealth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f115a16ddc9be61c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Stacey Abrams net worth in 2021: property, salary, income sources</span></p></a><h3>Political career earnings</h3><p class=align-left>Maxine Waters is on her fifteenth term, serving the United States people for an extended time. She started as a telephone operator for a garment factory. Maxine's debut into the political environment was in 1973. She worked for City Councilman David S. Cunningham as a Chief Deputy. Eventually, she made her way into the California State Assembly in 1976.</p><p class=align-left>Maxine waters salary is $174, 000 and was previously earning $193,400 every year from 1997 to 1999. She has been a Representative of the House for the 29th and 35 districts. Her popularity rating massively increased when she debated Peter King in 1994. Maxine has also served as the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus from 1997 to 1998.</p><p class=align-left>In 2012, Maxine became a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Here, she rubbed shoulders with prominent political personalities and worked closely with Barrack Obama, George W. Bush, and the current Donald Trump. However, this did not deter her from expressing her personal opinion about each President's policies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5fba3e432f2be68d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shanna Mendiola: 7 facts about the NBC Los Angeles weather girl</span></p></a><h3>Maxine Waters’ properties</h3><p class=align-left>Maxine has an extensive portfolio of assets under her name, which she has gradually accumulated during her long career as a politician.
