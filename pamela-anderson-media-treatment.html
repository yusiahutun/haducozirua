The eight-part series, which premieres this week, will be released more than 25 years after the tape itself and has re-opened discussions about its legacy, forcing a reckoning with just how the world treated one of the video’s stars: Pamela Anderson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show opens on how exactly this incredibly private tape, made on the couple’s honeymoon in 1995, came to be released to the public. It was stolen from their home by a disgruntled construction worker, Rand Gauthier (played by Seth Rogen). You learn he may have quite a justified axe to grind against the perennially indecisive and rude Lee, who not only fires him but fails to pay him an alleged $20k. His revenge was to sell the private tape he stole on the latest tech fad – the internet – where he advertised VHS copies of Pamela’s Hardcore Sex Tape for $59.99 (about £40) – shipping them around the world.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Pam & Tommy | Official Trailer" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pam-and-tommy-disney-plus-lily-james-as-pamela-anderson-sebastian-stan-as-tommy-lee-1643643887.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’m on the tape, same as you are,” Stan says, as Tommy Lee, when the couple eventually discover their private life has been made a globally-accessible porno. “Not like me you’re not,” Lily James’ Pamela replies, in one of the show’s most telling exchanges. For a start, the video was not called Tommy Lee’s Hardcore Sex Tape. Pamela Anderson, Baywatch star and Playboy model, was the draw, and she was the one who would most keenly feel the consequences of the leaked tape. The show reveals how openly and unabashedly Anderson is sexualised by work colleagues, lawyers, the paparazzi… even before the tape was released. It may have been Lee whom Gauthier wanted to make pay, but it was Anderson who paid the price.</p><img alt="lily james pamela anderson" title="lily james pamela anderson" width=4000 height=6000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/first-look-pam-and-tommy-disney-plus-lily-james-as-pamela-anderson-1643726418.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2"> Erica Parise</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Disney+</span><p>Lily James as Pamela Anderson in Pam & Tommy</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the couple attempted to sue and have the video – stolen property, let us not forget – removed from the internet, they were shockingly denied. This may seem baffling to us now, with our increasing awareness of, and legislation against, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a27565196/amber-heard-revenge-porn-nude-hacking/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="revenge porn" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">revenge porn</a>, but back in 1996, this was not the case. Following several unsuccessful lawsuits, Lee and Anderson eventually signed away their rights to the tape and by 1998 it was on sale in adult video stores around the world, making Pamela Anderson the ‘most downloaded star of all time’ according to the Guinness Book of Records. Pamela Anderson, let's be clear, not Tommy Lee.<br></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The simple fact is, that sex tapes or <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a37372657/monica-lewinsky-story-shaming-women/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sexual scandals" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">sexual scandals</a> – anything involving sex for that matter – do not tarnish a man’s reputation the way it does for women. Pamela and Tommy argue this point repeatedly throughout the show. While he received back slaps and high fives for his penis length and the 'hotness' of his wife, Pamela is looked at through narrowed eyes of judgement or, in one excruciating scene, through the condensation of the press, who feel she is audacious to attempt an actual film career as opposed to just taking her top off.<br></p><img alt="kanye west and julia fox" title="Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee" width=2242 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pamela-anderson-tommy-lee-1643816130.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Steve.Granitz/INACTIVE</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Anderson and Lee in Las Vegas in 1995</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The trope of the ‘fallen’ woman is as old as time and has had remarkable staying power through centuries of shifting societal and sexual mores. Yet, it seems, no matter how liberated we become, there is still a searing double standard at work. This is especially so for women in the public eye, for whom we seem to reserve our harshest judgements and highest standards. Look at how <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a35457230/framing-britney-spears-documentary-downfall-reaction/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Britney Spears was both sexualised and then condemned for it" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Britney Spears was both sexualised and then condemned for it</a>, look at how willingly <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/g35489023/10-famous-women-who-were-brutally-destroyed-by-the-press/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="we turned our back on countless famous women" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">we turned our back on countless famous women</a>, who were judged on their sex lives in a way their paramours never were. It was for this very reason that the couple were unable to successfully block the tape. Lawyers and judges at the time ruled that, since Anderson had famously posed nude several times and had been incredibly open about her sex life in the media – she had forfeited her right to privacy.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Sluts don't have rights," says Pamela, in one of the show's later episodes, and it echoes her real-life comments. “It was great sitting through depositions, where old men would hold up pictures of me naked in Playboy and ask why I’d even care that the tape was out there,” Anderson said in Lee’s 2004 autobiography Tommyland. “I couldn’t handle it. It got to a point where I could not go to another deposition with these sweaty old guys asking me about my sex life.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The sex positivity movement, the rise of OnlyFans, the move to make feminism a more inclusive space for sex workers; these are all great strides forward. Perhaps a press conference today would not dare ask Britney about her breasts or Pamela Anderson about her sex tape, but how much have we really changed? Though we now think differently – legally speaking at least – about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/a38080316/claire-foy-very-british-scandal-dirty-duchess/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="revenge porn and leaked nudes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">revenge porn and leaked nudes</a>, which have become more and more of an issue since the growth of the internet and the advent of smart phones, how far have we really come in the way we view a woman’s sexuality?</p><img alt="1996 file photo of pamela anderson and tommy lee at the planet boom in north hollywood, california photo by jeffrey mayerwireimage" title="1996 File Photo of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee" width=2080 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pamela-anderson-and-tommy-lee-1643816210.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeffrey Mayer</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Anderson and Lee in California in 1996</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As lately as this year, the young actress Sydney Sweeney commented that her nude scenes in the cult HBO show Euphoria, have had an effect on her career. “I’m very proud of my work in Euphoria. I thought it was a great performance. But no one talks about it because I got naked,” she said, in a recent interview. “I do <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a37307134/the-white-lotus-uk-release-date/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The White Lotus " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The White Lotus </a>and all of a sudden, critics are paying attention. People are loving me. They’re going, ‘Oh my god, what’s she doing next?’ I was like, ‘Did you not see that in Euphoria? This is something that has bothered me for a while.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a remarkable act of life imitating art, Pam & Tommy star Lily James has had to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a36379304/lily-james-pamela-anderson/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="defend her sex scenes and nudity" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">defend her sex scenes and nudity</a> (despite wearing a prosthetic chest) in the series, and it is somewhat ironic that Anderson herself has reportedly commented she finds it "shocking" that the show had been created without her consent. It is a startling revelation which shows that, despite the fact the show is aimed as a critique of this mindset of judgement, it still prevails. And no matter how admirably (and successfully) the show portrays the unjust violation of the pair, it has similarly chosen to dramatise some of their most intimate moments for entertainment without them having a say. Even now, she is still being treated as fair game.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>She would still be ‘that woman on the sex tape’ in the way that Tommy Lee is not<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We have – perhaps for too long – viewed the title of celebrity as being a hall pass for exploitation, abuse or invasion of privacy. This is especially so for women, and even more so for women who have the audacity to be publicly sexual and who disproportionately bear the brunt of online trolling and societal derision. We may like to think we have moved past the 1996 sex tape of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, but the fledgling internet that launched the tape has become a behemoth today in which 58 per cent of girls and young women are abused or sexually harassed, celebrity or not.</p><img alt="lily james pamela anderson" title="lily james pamela anderson" width=470 height=712 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pam-and-tommy-disney-plus-1-1643725634.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Disney+</span><p>Lily James as Pamela Anderson in Pam & Tommy</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, if Pamela Anderson were to have a leaked sex tape today, would she be treated the same way? Legally speaking, probably not, but in terms of reputation damage, it seems not much would change. She would still be ‘that woman on the sex tape’ in the way that Tommy Lee is not, that Paris Hilton’s Rick Soloman is not, nor Kim Kardashian’s Ray J. We may be making sex-positive strides in 2022, but it seems that society, and especially the internet, the original home of Pamela and Tommy’s tape, remains rigorously run by a male gaze. It may not be 1996 anymore, but it seems we will still download and shun, demand and condemn the sexual behaviour of women.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first episode of 'Pam & Tommy' is available to stream now on Disney+ in the UK with further episodes dropping weekly.
