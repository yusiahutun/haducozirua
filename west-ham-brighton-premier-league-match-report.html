West Ham and Brighton were two tired, injury-hit teams trying their best and giving their all without ever really suggesting they had the wit or energy to score a goal.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>At the end the biggest takeaway was it will be tough for both to remain above richer rivals as the season wears on. While West Ham ended 2023 with <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">fine wins over Arsenal</a> and Manchester United, the limitations of their squad were exposed by the absence of Lucas Paquetá and Mohammed Kudus. They remain sixth, three points above Brighton after a dogged defensive display, but it was not a surprise to hear David Moyes admit he would love to bring in reinforcements if money is available this month.</p><figure id=b7458fb4-036f-4c8e-a0b3-8703cbae6d61 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>West Ham should not gamble: it’s time to extend David Moyes’s contract | Jacob SteinbergRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>“We want to keep building,” said Moyes, who went on to complain about the timing of this fixture depriving him of his African players. Kudus, who might not have played anyway because of a hamstring injury, has joined Ghana’s training camp for the Africa Cup of Nations, while Nayef Aguerd is with Morocco. Egypt’s Mohammed Salah, Moyes noted, was available to play in <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Liverpool’s win over Newcastle</a> on New Year’s Day.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>The riposte is that West Ham could help themselves by having better deputies for Kudus. Pablo Fornals struggled on the right and Saïd Benrahma, who played as though determined to ward off potential suitors this month, was awful in Paquetá’s place on the left. Even then Danny Ings and Maxwel Cornet, two expensive forward signings, both remained on the bench.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>All of which is something for Tim Steidten, West Ham’s technical director, to consider as he hunts for incomings. While Moyes spoke of resilience, West Ham’s refusal to give up a point could not disguise the fact Brighton dealt better with their injuries and created the better chances on a night when Roberto De Zerbi’s forwards were repeatedly thwarted by Alphonse Areola.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>De Zerbi had a similar view after watching his side claim their first clean sheet of the season. “We played an amazing game,” Brighton’s manager said. “One of the best in my time. We created a lot of chances.”</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>The question facing both of these clubs is whether they have enough depth to sustain their challenges for European football. Both are in the Europa League and weariness is an issue. Whereas bigger clubs are more accustomed to handling the load, there inevitably comes a point when teams of the size of West Ham and Brighton struggle to defy financial reality.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>It certainly felt that way here. West Ham, who were dealing with a sickness bug again, were never going to be as dangerous without Kudus and Paquetá in attack. “They’re fantastic players” Moyes said. “The other players need them.” Still, while Moyes had seven out, Brighton had nine absentees. The visitors arranged themselves in a fluid 3-4-3 system but they lacked a spark with Kaoru Mitoma, Simon Adingra and Ansu Fati unavailable on the flanks.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Opportunities were rare. West Ham sat back and were insipid in the final third. Their best chance came when Benrahma’s deflected cross fell for James Ward-Prowse to volley at Jason Steele. Brighton, who kept Jarrod Bowen quiet, responded with chances for Jack Hinshelwood and Pascal Gross. Areola denied them.</p><figure id=bdf4c1d6-d126-49cc-9fbf-1a1dbdc65301 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Adam Lallana launches an unsuccessful effort at goal for Brighton.</span> Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</figure><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>West Ham went close from a set piece, Edson Álvarez and Konstantinos Mavropanos almost converting Emerson Palmieri’s cross, but Brighton were slicker. They pushed at the start of the second half, Billy Gilmour running midfield, and Danny Welbeck tested Areola. Then João Pedro dribbled in from the left, a stunning solo goal on the cards until he shot straight at West Ham’s goalkeeper.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><a data-ignore=global-link-styling href=# class=dcr-porppu>skip past newsletter promotion</a><p class=dcr-1ki5f>Sign up to <span>Football Daily</span></p><span class=dcr-ld1976>Free daily newsletter</span><p class=dcr-k17n11>Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football</p><span class=dcr-10ejt2b><strong>Privacy Notice: </strong>Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The young striker almost made an instant impact, brilliantly turning Álvarez, but his shot fizzed wide.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>It became a real test of West Ham’s defensive steel. Brighton, who saw Adam Webster limp off on his first start since November, went close when Jakub Moder, on as a substitute, missed a glorious chance. Another substitute, Adam Lallana, almost beat Areola. Ben Johnson, West Ham’s right-back, went down with cramp. The final whistle was welcome.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ6fpMGjrculZmtoYml8q63NaGdrZ6eawLV5x5qkZpqinrSpwM6nZKmqlaK2pr6MpZyan6Waeq6t05yfZqqVpbyzwA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwest-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report.html&text=Alphonse%20Areola%20defiant%20as%20West%20Ham%20frustrate%20Brighton%20in%20stalemate%20%7c%20Premier%20League&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwest-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwest-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report.html&title=Alphonse%20Areola%20defiant%20as%20West%20Ham%20frustrate%20Brighton%20in%20stalemate%20%7c%20Premier%20League" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwest-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report.html&title=Alphonse%20Areola%20defiant%20as%20West%20Ham%20frustrate%20Brighton%20in%20stalemate%20%7c%20Premier%20League" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwest-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report.html&title=Alphonse%20Areola%20defiant%20as%20West%20Ham%20frustrate%20Brighton%20in%20stalemate%20%7c%20Premier%20League" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwest-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report.html&description=Alphonse%20Areola%20defiant%20as%20West%20Ham%20frustrate%20Brighton%20in%20stalemate%20%7c%20Premier%20League" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./argentinian-rapper-duki-announces-his-first-north-american-tour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Argentinian Rapper Duki Announces His First North American Tour">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mae-middleton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Mae Middleton dating?
