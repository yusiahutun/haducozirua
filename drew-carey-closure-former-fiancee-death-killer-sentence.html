"Just speaking just for myself, it's been quite a load off."</p><p>Pursehouse was convicted of first-degree murder and first-degree burglary after the death of Harwick in her home in the early morning hours after Valentine's Day, 2020.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged that Pursehouse lay in wait for Harwick the day before, Valentine's Day, with intentions of killing her with a fatal overdose of nicotine. They argued that he strangled her and threw her off her third-floor Hollywood Hills balcony after her screams woke a downstairs neighbor and then fled the scene.</p><p>When he was arrested, he was covered in fresh cuts and bruises, while a syringe matching the brand as the one filled with nicotine at Harwick's was also discovered at his home.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:88614bea-45a5-4d78-a721-639f93bb75f6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:bf8cab40-771e-445b-ae02-fcb916793f87 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a2/5by4/2023/09/29/a22880529c954983a2691a3432f6715b_xs.png width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Amie Harwick's Ex-Boyfriend Found Guilty of First-Degree Murder, Faces Life Sentence</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to the prosecution, Pursehouse was obsessed with Harwick, with her expressing her fear of him in texts to friends after seeing him at an event a month prior to her death. At the event, the two spoke, with Harwick's colleague and friend Dr. Hernando Chaves testifying he overheard Pursehouse telling Harwick, "You ruined my life, you bitch."</p><p>They further alleged Harwick expressed she was afraid of Pursehouse and had gotten two restraining orders against him. He attempted to stay in contact with her after this encounter, the prosecution proved by showing text messages she received after he found her number online.</p><p>"He didn't go there to talk. He's on a mission. He's angry. He feels rejected," said the prosecution, per Los Angeles' <a href=#><strong>ABC7</strong></a>. Pursehouse and Harwick had originally dated for about 18 months prior, with Harwick obtaining a restraining order against Pursehouse in 2012.</p><p>Two years before her death, Carey had Harwick on The Price Is Right for a special Valentine's Day-themed episode. She and the comedian first met at a Hollywood party in 2017 before getting engaged in 2018.</p><p>Though their relationship ended later that year, Carey told <a href=#><strong>People </strong></a>after her murder, "Amie and I had a love that people are lucky to have once in a lifetime."</p><p>He still has photos of her around his house, and one in his dressing room on the long-running game show, telling the outlet, "She's with me always."</p><a id=gallery-link-f5a2389d-a9ef-4e23-a40a-cc395770fbca class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:f5a2389d-a9ef-4e23-a40a-cc395770fbca data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:bf8cab40-771e-445b-ae02-fcb916793f87 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fa/4by3/2024/03/04/fa8e59c78d3f45a9b9b250f86de763f3_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmaW5fmb%2Bmw4ycmKudqWKwrbvSrqmeZZakv66x0WadopmemLKmecOemK2gXaC2rbjEq2SsnZ6psq%2BvxGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdrew-carey-closure-former-fiancee-death-killer-sentence.html&text=Drew%20Carey%20Finds%20Closure%20Over%20Former%20Fiancee%27s%20Death%20After%20Her%20Killer%27s%20Sentence&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrew-carey-closure-former-fiancee-death-killer-sentence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrew-carey-closure-former-fiancee-death-killer-sentence.html&title=Drew%20Carey%20Finds%20Closure%20Over%20Former%20Fiancee%27s%20Death%20After%20Her%20Killer%27s%20Sentence" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdrew-carey-closure-former-fiancee-death-killer-sentence.html&title=Drew%20Carey%20Finds%20Closure%20Over%20Former%20Fiancee%27s%20Death%20After%20Her%20Killer%27s%20Sentence" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdrew-carey-closure-former-fiancee-death-killer-sentence.html&title=Drew%20Carey%20Finds%20Closure%20Over%20Former%20Fiancee%27s%20Death%20After%20Her%20Killer%27s%20Sentence" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrew-carey-closure-former-fiancee-death-killer-sentence.html&description=Drew%20Carey%20Finds%20Closure%20Over%20Former%20Fiancee%27s%20Death%20After%20Her%20Killer%27s%20Sentence" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./iacp-of-kerala-region-dismissed-actress-lena-as-a-licensed-clinical-psychologist.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="IACP, Kerala published a statement that Lena is not a licensed clinical psychologist">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./484309-does-natalia-dyer-eating-disorder-anorexic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Natalia Dyer have an eating disorder?
