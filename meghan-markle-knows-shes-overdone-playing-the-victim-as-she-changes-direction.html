The duchess was seen in a Clver Blends commercial, and they claim she’s trying to give herself a rebranding.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> has had her first starring role since 2017 … as someone who works in admin for a coffee company. The Duchess of Sussex can be seen in various shots, though she never speaks or even looks at the camera. The 42-year-old hung up her acting career when she married <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> in 2018, but now seems to be venturing back out into the world of showbiz. Experts, however, say this is part of a rebranding for her to become a “kind, compassionate, entertaining” media personality.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-s-return-to-acting-in-clver-commercial>Meghan Markle’s return to acting in Clver commercial</h2><p>In the advert for Clevr Blends, a Santa Barbara-based independent tea and latte brand, Meghan can be seen working away at a desk and typing on her computer. This follows several failed business ventures. Earlier this year, she and her husband <a href=#>parted ways with Spotify</a> after only 12 episodes of her podcast, Archetypes, were made.</p><p>The actress was previously on the <a href=#>TV</a> series Suits, an American law drama in which she played Rachel Zane. She played the character for seven years from 2011 until 2018 (her last scenes were filmed in 2017).</p><p>But her small return could be for a rebranding, say experts.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince William has been fretting over Harry since he gave ‘warning over Meghan’</a></p><p>“It’s also a way of showing Meghan in a new light that is both fun and frivolous,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> brand and culture expert Nick Ede.</p><p>“Does it work? I think that Meghan is now such a polarizing figure that comments on the social media post are negative and not celebratory, which is a shame, as the post was meant to be a showing off the success and hard work of the business.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-we-ll-see-a-lot-more-of-meghan>‘We’ll see a lot more of Meghan’</h2><p>He added, she should enjoy what she has now rather than “claiming her life is a misery because of what happened to her while in the&nbsp;<a href=#>royal</a> family.”</p><p>Ede, who used to be friends with the <a href=#>celebrity</a>, said she has a “rehabilitation plan” and this commercial was her “departure from worthiness and dramatic revelations.”</p><p>“I think we will see a lot more personality-led content created that concentrates on Meghan as a media personality who is kind, compassionate, entertaining, and not afraid to poke fun at herself,” the former friend of the Duchess explained.</p><p>Although, he wasn’t sure whether it would “win over” those who aren’t her biggest fans. But “from a brand point of view, it’s the strongest and most authentic way to rebuild her reputation and credibility.”</p><p>Royal expert Phil Dampier added: “I think she realizes that she and Harry have overdone the victim card.</p><p>“She is also being advised by new PR people and I’m sure they have said they need to be more positive and not just live off criticizing the royal family.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-react-to-meghan-markle-s-clvr-cameo>Fans react to Meghan Markle’s Clvr cameo</h2><p>In the comments under Clver Blends’ commercial which features Meghan Markle on their <a href=#>Instagram</a>, they wrote: “Damn, you’re keeping us BUSY right now! Had to call in some reinforcements [eyes emoji].”</p><p>“Wait…is that Her Royal Highness??” asked one person.</p><p>Another wrote: “The new hire deserves a raise and bonus and benefits. She is a multitasking Queen. Clearly.”</p><p>“Always willing to roll up her sleeves and do the work. We love a hardworking duchess.”</p><p>A fourth said: “Love your new employee” and added a heart-eye emoji.</p><p>However, others weren’t so impressed.</p><p>One person wrote: “Imagine that going from being a Senior Royal with a world platform, to packing coffee for a small company. My how far she has fallen. What’s next, bagging groceries at Whole Foods.”</p><p>“Markle is not Royal! She’s a drama queen who doesn’t get along with her family or his family!” said another. “She’s so inauthentic and the most annoying celebrity!”</p><p>A third penned: “You’ll be sorry getting her to promote your business…… haven’t you heard….. biggest losers in Hollywood and biggest grifters, she ain’t no Royal.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-has-previously-teased-returning-to-hollywood>Meghan has previously teased returning to Hollywood</h2><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle’s small role in the Clver Blends</a> commercial comes a month after she was on the red carpet for Variety’s Power of Women event. There, she explained she would return to our screens but <a href=#>this time behind the camera</a>.</p><p>“[I want to make] things that make people feel – I was going to say ‘good,’ but it’s more than that, things that make people feel something, right? And feel a sense of community,” she said.</p><p>“Ee have so many exciting things on the slate. I can’t wait until we can announce them, but I’m just really proud of what we’re creating.”</p><p>Harry is also apparently “loving” their new ventures with platforms like Netflix. She said the couple are finding it “really fun.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2d%2BcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kpKafrMBuv8eeqmanppq%2FpbvNnmSppJGutq%2BzjK2fnmWmnrC1tcxmmKxlo52ybq%2FHmqWgnaNisaq%2BxJyroqeeZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeghan-markle-knows-shes-overdone-playing-the-victim-as-she-changes-direction.html&text=Meghan%20Markle%20knows%20she%27s%20%27overdone%20playing%20the%20victim%27%20as%20she%20changes%20direction&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeghan-markle-knows-shes-overdone-playing-the-victim-as-she-changes-direction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markle-knows-shes-overdone-playing-the-victim-as-she-changes-direction.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%20knows%20she%27s%20%27overdone%20playing%20the%20victim%27%20as%20she%20changes%20direction" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeghan-markle-knows-shes-overdone-playing-the-victim-as-she-changes-direction.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%20knows%20she%27s%20%27overdone%20playing%20the%20victim%27%20as%20she%20changes%20direction" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markle-knows-shes-overdone-playing-the-victim-as-she-changes-direction.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%20knows%20she%27s%20%27overdone%20playing%20the%20victim%27%20as%20she%20changes%20direction" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeghan-markle-knows-shes-overdone-playing-the-victim-as-she-changes-direction.html&description=Meghan%20Markle%20knows%20she%27s%20%27overdone%20playing%20the%20victim%27%20as%20she%20changes%20direction" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./princess-diana-harvard-sweatshirt-the-crown.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Princess Dianas Harvard Sweatshirt Was the Ultimate Collusion Casual">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kristanna-loken.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristanna Loken - Bio, Age, Career, Height, Net Worth, Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
