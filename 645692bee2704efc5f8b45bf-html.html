We are talking about one of the most important non-fiction filmmakers in cinema history. He was arguably the main proponent of Westerns as an actor. His '<strong>Unforgiven</strong>' film is considered the greatest Western in cinema history. As a director in the modern era, he has created incredible films such as <strong>'Mistic River' or 'Million Dollar Baby'</strong>. All his movies tend to be critically acclaimed. But like <strong><a href=#>Jack Nicholson</a></strong>, Clint is already at an advanced age that probably prevents him to keep working.</p><p>The man is <strong>92 </strong>years old, he is really up there and <strong><a href=#>concerns </a></strong>about his overall health have escalated in recent weeks. <strong>Radar Online</strong> reports that a friend who is close to him is deeply worried about Clint because he hasn't been seen by friends in 455 days, and counting. After his most recent movie (Cry Macho) bombed at the box office, Eastwood decided he would take one last crack at directing before father time catches up to him. He is getting ready to shoot his final film called, 'Juror No. 2' with Toni Collette and Nicholas Hoult. But people are truly worried about him for not showing his face to the world in nearly two years.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Clint Eastwood's last project?</h2><p>Here's what the insider told the folks from Radar Online: "Clint goes through spells of talking about retirement, but what's worse for him, he feels the movie industry has retired on him. He's had a 50-year partnership with Warner Brothers, but there are new people in charge there now and they were very disappointed Clint's last movie Cry Macho bombed at the box office. He was happy to finally get a go-ahead from Warner for his new film, but he isn't counting on it happening again. He wants to do this movie as a swan song and go out in a blazing sunset."</p><p>The source continued: "Some thought Cry Macho was going to be his last film two years ago because he seemed frail even then, but the movie wasn't well received so Clint's gathering up the troops one last time - and hoping for a blockbuster. People do worry about his health. He's the director, but he's also involved in every other aspect like the casting and he'll likely compose the score as he's done on his other films. Clint has always enjoyed great health and been vital and active despite his advancing age, but the fact that he hasn't been around as much lately has a lot of people in Hollywood worried about him. It's hard to imagine him in anything other than fine form but Father Time catches up to all of us."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJofHGBjmltaG5kaoN6fsGenGtvYGmyp6%2BUn2%2BbbGWXs2%2B006aj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f645692bee2704efc5f8b45bf-html.html&text=Clint%20Eastwood%20is%20the%20latest%20legend%20who%20is%20M.I.A.%20and%20hasn%27t%20been%20seen%20in%20455%20days&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f645692bee2704efc5f8b45bf-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f645692bee2704efc5f8b45bf-html.html&title=Clint%20Eastwood%20is%20the%20latest%20legend%20who%20is%20M.I.A.%20and%20hasn%27t%20been%20seen%20in%20455%20days" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f645692bee2704efc5f8b45bf-html.html&title=Clint%20Eastwood%20is%20the%20latest%20legend%20who%20is%20M.I.A.%20and%20hasn%27t%20been%20seen%20in%20455%20days" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f645692bee2704efc5f8b45bf-html.html&title=Clint%20Eastwood%20is%20the%20latest%20legend%20who%20is%20M.I.A.%20and%20hasn%27t%20been%20seen%20in%20455%20days" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f645692bee2704efc5f8b45bf-html.html&description=Clint%20Eastwood%20is%20the%20latest%20legend%20who%20is%20M.I.A.%20and%20hasn%27t%20been%20seen%20in%20455%20days" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./0-rbriw4gb.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drew Carey -- Bob Barker Prison Soap">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./big-sky-amphitheater-cancels-its-2021-concert-season.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Big Sky Amphitheater Cancels Its 2021 Concert Season">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
