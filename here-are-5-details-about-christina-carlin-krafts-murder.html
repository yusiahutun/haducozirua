Her body also revealed evidence of a violent fight, most likely with the murderer, that occurred before her death.</strong></p><p>Soon after, a thorough investigation, CCTV footage, and several leads led investigators to an accused drug dealer named Jonathan Harris, who had recently been released from prison. Harris was apprehended while attempting to flee the state and later admitted his guilt.</p><p>This week’s episode of The Playboy Murders on the ID will look into the 2018 murder of Christina Carlin-Kraft. The premiere of Moth to a Flame will take place on Monday, February 6, 2023, at 10 p.m. ET. The synopsis reads as follows:</p><p><strong>“The murder of Playboy cybergirl Christina Carlin-Kraft in her Pennsylvania apartment leads authorities from Philadelphia’s streets to a mental institution; investigators rely on surveillance footage to find the perpetrator.”</strong></p><h2><span id=Kraft8217s_Christina_Carlin_Murder_Five_quick_facts_about_the_former_Playboy_model8217s_death_by_strangulation>Kraft’s Christina Carlin Murder Five quick facts about the former Playboy model’s death by strangulation</span></h2><h2><span id=1_Christina_Carlin-Kraft_had_recently_moved_into_a_new_apartment>1) Christina Carlin-Kraft had recently moved into a new apartment</span></h2><p>Christina proposed to her long-term boyfriend Alexander Ciccotelli in 2018 after he bought her an apartment in Ardmore, an upscale Philadelphia neighborhood. She had only recently moved into the house.</p><p>However, a short time later, a man who had drugged Christina’s drink at a pub followed her home and broke into her house, stealing a few of her luxury bags and jewels. Andre Melton was ultimately convicted of burglary, criminal trespass, and theft by taking and receiving stolen items.</p><h2><span id=2_Her_heinous_murder_was_the_result_of_the_break-in>2) Her heinous murder was the result of the break-in</span></h2><p>Despite being shaken by the break-in and burglary, Christina Carlin-Kraft set out for the city center in the early morning hours of August 22. The next day, her body was discovered in her home. Christina’s fiancé, Ciccotelli, only called 911 because he couldn’t get into her apartment, which was locked from the inside. When she did not return his calls, he became concerned.</p><h2><span id=3_Christina_Carlin-Kraft_was_beaten_to_death_and_strangled>3) Christina Carlin-Kraft was beaten to death and strangled</span></h2><p>Christina’s body was discovered wrapped in a blanket at a violent murder scene. Prior to her death, the 36-year-old was violently abused, as evidenced by her nose being fractured and her eyes darkening in the areas where she was struck. An autopsy revealed that she died as a result of strangulation.</p><h2><span id=4_Her_assassin_Jonathan_Harris_claimed_she_had_attacked_him_first>4) Her assassin, Jonathan Harris, claimed she had attacked him first</span></h2><p>Using surveillance video, the information provided by a Lyft taxi driver, and other tips, authorities were able to apprehend 30-year-old Jonathan Harris, an accused drug dealer who had just been released from jail a few days before Christina Carlin’s murder. Harris was apprehended a few days after the murder while attempting to flee on a bus near Pittsburgh.</p><p>Harris confessed to killing Christina after being arrested, telling authorities that they had consensual s*x, drank wine, and took cocaine that night. He also claimed that they got into an argument after the model refused to pay $1,200 for the drugs. Christina, according to his testimony, hit him with a wine bottle, after which he punched her several times. He then “began choking her” as she dialed 911.</p><h2><span id=5_Harris_was_sentenced_to_life_in_prison_with_additional_consecutive_sentences>5) Harris was sentenced to life in prison with additional consecutive sentences</span></h2><p>At Jonathan Harris’ 2019 trial, one of his hospital detainees testified that he had previously confessed to murdering Christina Carlin-Kraft, telling him that there was “nothing like squeezing someone and feeling the last breath leave their body.”</p><p>Harris was eventually found guilty of murder, kidnapping, criminal possession of an instrument, and strangling. On the other counts, he was sentenced to life in prison plus 22-and-a-half to 45 years in prison.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Model</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Skye Stracke</a></h3>Skye Stracke estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
