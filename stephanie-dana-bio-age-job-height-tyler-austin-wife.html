Learn more about her in this Stephanie Dana Bio.</p><p>Here, you’ll learn about her age, her job, her height, and details related to her family.</p><h3><strong>Meet Stephanie Dana, Tyler Austin Wife!</strong></h3><p>Stephanie Dana and her husband MLB star husband Tyler Austin met each other while Tyler was attending Heritage High School in 2009. They were high school juniors at the time. At the time, Stephanie was the manager of her school’s baseball team which was the rival of Tyler’s school team.</p><p>Stephanie and Tyler met each other at a party but they didn’t hit it off immediately. At their first meeting, Tyler boasted about how many home runs he was going to beat Salem High School, which Stephanie attended, with. Listening to that, Stephanie walked away annoyed at him.</p><p>But, on the game day between Salem and Heritage high, Tyler struck out the first time. He was booed and was name-called, and Stephanie was furious at her friends’ behavior. The second time he came out, Stephanie was the only one cheering for him from her team’s dugout. She was chastised for supporting the opposing team, especially after Austin hit many home runs. Stephanie Dana was always standing up for Tyler Austin and cheering him on from that point forward.</p><p>Soon the couple started dating each other and have been together ever since.</p><p>Stephanie and Tyler got engaged on 12 January 2018. She wrote on her Instagram post, “On July 4, 2009, you asked me to be your girlfriend for the first time. Last night, on January 12, 2018, you asked me to marry you. We grew up together, and now we will grow old together. I love you Christopher Tyler!”</p><p>Furthermore, a year later on 26 January 2019, the engaged couple tied the knots. After 1 month of getting married, Stephanie updated on her IG, “1 month married!! 1 month, 2 moves, 3 beach runs, 4 furniture store visits, 5 trips to Home Goods (just discovered that treasure trove), 6 Girl Scout cookie boxes devoured, 15 hrs on the road, over/ under 800 steps climbed (living at a 3rd story walk-up) and countless “I love you. I’m so lucky to have you, Chi Ty!”.</p><p>On her second wedding anniversary, Stephanie posted a photo collage of herself and her husband. She wrote, “I’m so happy I get to exist at the same time as you!! I love you <a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@taustin2121</a>! Happy anniversary stud muffin!! (I think year 2 is the year you get a nickname)”.</p><h3><strong>Stephanie Dana Age</strong></h3><p>Born on 17 March 1992, Stephanie Dana is 29 years old.</p><h3><strong>Stephanie Dana Job</strong></h3><p>Talking about her job, Stephanie Dana is a fashion model.
