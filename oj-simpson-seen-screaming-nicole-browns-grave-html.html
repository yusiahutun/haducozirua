Something that he couldn’t quite control.

She quickly told OJ that she'd only let him "play" with her. She didn't admit to actual intercourse,' wrote Resnick in her book, Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘OJ exploded. He turned on her like a man possessed. Nicole told me OJ threatened her, saying "If you're ever with Marcus again, I'll...I don't know what I'll do, but it will be bad. I won't be able to control myself.”’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also wrote in that same passage: ‘At times we were worried that OJ might take revenge on Marcus by telling his fiancée Kathryn about the affair with Nicole. That would have been a disaster, because Kathryn was a sweet woman who was well aware of Marcus' womanizing and might have felt she had to call off the wedding.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Later in the book Resnick also writes that Allen had pursued her and that she called up Kris Jenner for advice, who said: ‘He's the biggest womanizer in the world, and don't forget he's engaged to Kathryn. She turns a blind eye to his fooling around, but it hurts her when he does it publicly.’&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKCdYWQb2tyZ39%2FepS1zKmqqKZdqLKmuoysmqudkaK2r7OMh6Ccp5yaeoO%2BzrClrGWXp663sY2hq6ak</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2foj-simpson-seen-screaming-nicole-browns-grave-html.html&text=OJ%20Simpson%20was%20seen%20screaming%20at%20Nicole%20Brown%27s%20grave&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foj-simpson-seen-screaming-nicole-browns-grave-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2foj-simpson-seen-screaming-nicole-browns-grave-html.html&title=OJ%20Simpson%20was%20seen%20screaming%20at%20Nicole%20Brown%27s%20grave" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2foj-simpson-seen-screaming-nicole-browns-grave-html.html&title=OJ%20Simpson%20was%20seen%20screaming%20at%20Nicole%20Brown%27s%20grave" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2foj-simpson-seen-screaming-nicole-browns-grave-html.html&title=OJ%20Simpson%20was%20seen%20screaming%20at%20Nicole%20Brown%27s%20grave" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foj-simpson-seen-screaming-nicole-browns-grave-html.html&description=OJ%20Simpson%20was%20seen%20screaming%20at%20Nicole%20Brown%27s%20grave" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./biggest-highlights-prince-harry-memoir-book-spare.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Read the 11 Biggest Highlights from Prince Harry's Memoir, 'Spare'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cj-perry-and-miro-separate-after-7-years-of-marriage-find-out-why-they-split-1285675.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CJ Perry and Miro Separate After 7 Years of Marriage; Find Out Why They Split">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
