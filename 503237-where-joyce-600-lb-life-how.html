She was featured in Episode 7 of Season 8 of the popular reality <a href=#>series</a> in 2020. She was one of the heaviest people to be featured on the show.</p><h3>How many pounds did Joyce weigh when joining the show?</h3><p class=align-left>Joyce Del Viscovo entered the show at 758 pounds. She revealed that she had a food addiction, which caused her <a href=#>family</a> and friends to be gravely concerned about her health.

She stayed with her mother briefly before she moved in with her boyfriend and his children. Joyce was left under the care of her grandmother, who would overfeed her.</p><p class=align-left>She gained weight quickly and weight 90 pounds while she was still 8. Her mother was surprised when she noticed her massive weight and tried to introduce a diet to her.
