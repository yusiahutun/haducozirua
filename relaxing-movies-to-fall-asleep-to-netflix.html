That's why we've rounded up these relaxing movies to watch on Netflix.</p><p>These are movies to fall asleep to. Not because they're bad, but because they don't have any loud explosions and action sequences likely to wake you up with a start if you doze off.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=julie-and-julia>1. <a href=#>Julie and Julia</a></h2><p>Julie and Julia is a comedy drama starring Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Stanley Tucci. Do you really need to know more? OK, it features lots of cooking because it's based around the life of chef Julia Child and food blogger Julie Powell.</p><p>This is really two (true) stories in one, but it never feels bogged down by it because it's light, breezy and ultimately a whole load of fun.</p><h2 id=walt-disney-animation-studios-short-films-collection>2. <a href=#>Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection</a></h2><p>Disney not only produces great feature-length movies, but lots of innovative and fun shorts too. This collection packages up 12 of them, including The Little Matchgirl, The Ballad of Nessie, Tangled Ever After, and Frozen Fever.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Each short is introduced by different members of Disney, briefly-yet-interestingly talking about their work. The great thing is that if you feel yourself falling asleep, you can pause and not feel like you're stopping something halfway through.</p><p>If you enjoyed watching this, you should also check out <a href=#>the best movies and TV shows available on Disney+</a>.</p><h2 id=the-edge-of-seventeen-broken-url-removed>3. The Edge of Seventeen [Broken URL Removed]</h2><p>The Edge of Seventeen is worth watching for the always spectacular Hailee Steinfeld alone. She plays young girl Nadine, who is trying to make it through school with her best friend. However, when that friend begins dating her older brother, Nadine's life is thrown into turmoil.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This is better than the usual coming-of-age movie. The Edge of Seventeen is well observed, witty, and modern. If you like John Hughes movies, or comedies like Clueless and Mean Girls, you should enjoy this.</p><h2 id=the-little-prince>4. <a href=#>The Little Prince</a></h2><p>The Little Prince is a fantasy adventure based on the novella of the same name by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Much like the source material, the story is full of childlike wonder, framed as an elderly aviator telling his young neighbor about his life.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The Little Prince blends different styles of animation together gracefully. It's a great watch for younger children, but its timeless message will surely appeal to all ages. Besides, you're never too old to hear a fairy tale before bed.</p><h2 id=the-artist>5. <a href=#>The Artist</a></h2><p>The Artist is a superb choice to fall asleep to because it's a silent film. That means there can be no shouting or screaming dialogue to suddenly wake you up. It won lots of awards on its release in 2011, including three Oscars, and it's easy to see why.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The Artist is about a young actress and a silent film star and their relationship as talkies are coming into fashion. It feels simultaneously old school and modern, with two dazzling stars, sly comedy, and a pitch-perfect score.</p><h2 id=mary-and-the-witch-s-flower>6. <a href=#>Mary and the Witch's Flower</a></h2><p>If Mary and the Witch's Flower looks like a Studio Ghibli film (<a href=#>all of the Studio Ghibli films, ranked</a>), that's because the studio behind it was founded by some former employees. It's just as charming as Ghibli's productions, with evocative drawings, delightful animation, and enchanting music.</p><p>The story centers around young Mary, who finds a rare flower that grants magical powers. She enters a floating magical academy, but soon discovers that not all is as it seems. While it's a simple tale, it's still charming and makes for a relaxing watch.</p><h2 id=always-be-my-maybe>7. <a href=#>Always Be My Maybe</a></h2><p>Ali Wong and Randall Park are on top form in Always Be My Maybe, a movie about childhood friends who reconnect years after their teenage relationship went down the drain.</p><p>While this is a romantic comedy, it skirts the usually clichés and the end result is a feelgood, infectiously charming watch. You should try to stay awake long enough to witness a great cameo from Keanu Reeves.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=song-of-the-sea>8. <a href=#>Song of the Sea</a></h2><p>Song of the Sea is an animated film set in Ireland, which is an appealing concept in itself. What's more enticing is that this mixes stellar visuals with a melancholy fantasy story, as a young boy discovers that his sister is a mythical being who can transform herself into a seal.</p><p>You should definitely pay attention to the story if you can, but even if you don't then you'll be transported by the colorful and otherworldly art. Perhaps you'll dream that you're in the same world, if you're lucky!</p><h2 id=the-princess-and-the-frog>9. <a href=#>The Princess and the Frog</a></h2><p>While Walt Disney came to fame with hand drawn animation, the studio relies more on 3D nowadays. That's exactly why The Princess and the Frog is such a breath of fresh air and stands alongside classics like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin.</p><p>With a twist on the traditional tale, here the lead character Tiana kisses a frog and turns into one herself. She then goes on an adventure to try to become human again and achieve her dream of owning her own restaurant. The Princess and the Frog is full of great songs that will be perfect accompaniments to your slumber.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=saving-mr-banks>10. <a href=#>Saving Mr. Banks</a></h2><p>You can't go wrong with Tom Hanks. Saving Mr. Banks sees him take the role of the ultimate dream maker: Walt Disney.&nbsp;The film is set during the early 1960s, during which time Disney was trying to get the rights to author P.L. Travers' (played by the great Emma Thompson) books---one of which is Mary Poppins.</p><p>Of course, we all know that he succeeds in that quest, but it's the journey that's interesting because P.L. Travers is unimpressed by Disney's bright lights. Saving Mr. Banks is a sentimental, sweet watch that won't offend. Perfect for bedtime viewing.</p><h2 id=relaxing-tv-shows-to-fall-asleep-to>Relaxing TV Shows to Fall Asleep To</h2><p>Not only are these all excellent movies in their own right, but they also make for quiet, contemplative watches. Which makes a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood action fare. And makes them perfect movies to fall asleep to.</p><p>If you want some more things to watch as you nod off into dreamtime, here are some <a href=#>relaxing TV shows to watch on Netflix when you're stressed</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fp7KtrdeipaBlnaTDqrHSZquoZZaWua15wKyjnp2gYsGwec2eq5%2Bkma18</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frelaxing-movies-to-fall-asleep-to-netflix.html&text=10%20Relaxing%20Movies%20to%20Fall%20Asleep%20to%20on%20Netflix&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frelaxing-movies-to-fall-asleep-to-netflix.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frelaxing-movies-to-fall-asleep-to-netflix.html&title=10%20Relaxing%20Movies%20to%20Fall%20Asleep%20to%20on%20Netflix" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frelaxing-movies-to-fall-asleep-to-netflix.html&title=10%20Relaxing%20Movies%20to%20Fall%20Asleep%20to%20on%20Netflix" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frelaxing-movies-to-fall-asleep-to-netflix.html&title=10%20Relaxing%20Movies%20to%20Fall%20Asleep%20to%20on%20Netflix" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frelaxing-movies-to-fall-asleep-to-netflix.html&description=10%20Relaxing%20Movies%20to%20Fall%20Asleep%20to%20on%20Netflix" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./66218ae2ca4741b6658b456e-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="El espectculo del 'Dibu' Martnez tiene premio: ha ganado cinco tandas de penaltis seguidas!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-red-light-therapy-at-home.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 Best Red Light Therapy Devices to Shop in 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
