While the Netflix show takes its title from his debut theater offering of the same name, which <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/05/baby-reindeer-review-summerhall-edinburgh-festival-2019-richard-gadd data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=debuted class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">debuted</a> as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2019, his previous work also inspired the series. In 2016, Gadd took home the Edinburgh Comedy Award for his show <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/27/richard-gadd-wins-edinburgh-comedy-award data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Monkey See Monkey Do" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Monkey See Monkey Do</a>, in which he revealed the catastrophic sexual violence he experienced as a young comedian.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Discussing the success of Baby Reindeer's Edinburgh run, Gadd wrote in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://about.netflix.com/en/news/baby-reindeer-creator-richard-gadd-on-sharing-his-complicated-story-baby-reindeer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Netflix press release" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Netflix press release</a>, "All I ever wanted to do was capture something complicated about the human condition. That we all make mistakes. That no person is ever good or bad. That we are all lost souls looking for love in our own weird way."</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Yes, the real Martha left a lot of voicemails</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the Netflix series, Donny first connects with Martha after she wanders into the bar where he's working. He makes her a free cup of tea in an attempt to cheer her up, but Martha takes the kind gesture to heart in a big way. Before long, she's turning up at the bar daily, commenting on his Facebook posts, and sending him a slew of emails. When she starts invading Donny's real life by attending his comedy shows and harassing his trans girlfriend, it becomes clear that Martha may pose a legitimate threat. Eventually, the character acquires his phone number, and repeatedly leaves him voicemails, something the real Martha did, too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/richard-gadd-baby-reindeer-interview-stalking-martha-bush-theatre-london-tickets-a9145996.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Independent" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Independent</a>, Gadd shared that his stalker had sent him "41,071 emails, 350 hours of voicemail, 744 tweets, 46 Facebook messages, 106 pages of letters, sleeping pills, a woolly hat, a pair of brand new boxer shorts and a cuddly reindeer toy." With such a deluge of communication, it's perhaps unsurprising that Gadd needed to write a theater show to make sense of the experience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Writing in a press release, Gadd said of Martha's voice messages, "I would go to bed at night and still hear her in my ears. Her voice swirling around my head. Her words leaping around my eyelids as I tried to sleep." He also began categorizing the voicemails, much like Donny does in the show, and hoping to find evidence of wrongdoing in one of the messages.</p><img alt="jessica gunning as martha in baby reindeer" title="jessica gunning as martha in baby reindeer" width=1612 height=1068 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jessica-martha-662aba404799e.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>Jessica Gunning as Martha in Baby Reindeer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Importantly, Gadd wanted viewers to realize that the violence perpetuated by the real-life Darrien left him vulnerable to Martha's advances. "I wanted to show what Darrien did was perniciously evil whereas Marthaâ€™s behaviour came from a place of deep vulnerability," he told GQ.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While Martha is sentenced for stalking Donny in Netflix's Baby Reindeer, it's unclear whether the writer's real-life stalker faced any legal consequences. "The laws surrounding harassment and abuse are so stupid," Gadd explained to The Independent, suggesting that Martha's actions were conducted largely within the law. He also has made it clear that the real Martha is a victim, too. "It would have been wrong to paint her as a monster, because sheâ€™s unwell, and the systemâ€™s failed her," he told The Independent.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">No, you shouldn't search for the real Martha</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Baby Reindeer is based on a true story, some viewers have endeavored to uncover the real identities of the show's characters.

In an Instagram Story (via <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2024/04/baby-reindeer-richard-gadd-message-viewers-speculate-real-life-identities-1235894129/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Deadline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Deadline</a>), Gadd said, "People I love, have worked with, and admire... are unfairly getting caught up in speculation." He continued, "Please donâ€™t speculate on who any of the real life people could be."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jessica Gunning, who plays Martha in Baby Reindeer, also urged fans to avoid Googling the real people behind the show's characters. "I think it is quite sad and I would urge them to watch the show again and see that that was not the point of the show at all," she told the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cv2d8gel2j8o data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=BBC class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">BBC</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gadd has also repeatedly noted that he wanted to conceal the identity of his stalker, so as not to harm her. As the writer told GQ, "Weâ€™ve gone to such great lengths to disguise her to the point that I donâ€™t think she would recognise herself. Whatâ€™s been borrowed is an emotional truth, not a fact-by-fact profile of someone."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Richard Gadd feared sharing something so personal</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Writing and acting in Baby Reindeer was a difficult experience for Richard Gadd, who told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/baby-reindeer-cast-release-date-plot data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Tudum class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tudum</a>, "You are revisiting a period in your life, which was the worst period of your life. So itâ€™s running back towards an awful fire youâ€™ve been in."</p><img alt="a man and a woman sitting at a table with a bottle of wine" title="a man and a woman sitting at a table with a bottle of wine" width=1670 height=1030 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rein-662ac3a0ce3c5.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The TV series sticks pretty closely to the truth, too, with Gadd noting the importance of accurately telling the story. "Itâ€™s pretty truthful," he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/baby-reindeer-netflix-richard-gadd-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=GQ class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">GQ</a>. "Any time it veered too much into embellishment I would always want to pull it back. Itâ€™s extremely emotionally truthful." However, he also noted that it was important to change certain details to protect the identities of the people involved.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nava Mau, who plays Donny's girlfriend Teri in Baby Reindeer, praised the accuracy of her character's arc, telling Tudum, "[I]t felt like the first time reading a character that was written by someone who actually had known and loved a trans woman." She continued, "Thereâ€™s a light that I think pulsates out of that kind of vulnerability, and so all of the characters in the story then are cast in that light.
