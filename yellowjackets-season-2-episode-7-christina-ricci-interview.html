Every week we'll be interviewing someone from the addictive Showtime drama to discuss the shockers from the latest episode, get hints on what to look out for in the rest of the season, and to break down the Easter eggs that abound in the show's scripts, props, and even in its killer '90s soundtrack. (After all, it's the only series that deploys dramatic devices like Chekov's Tori Amos lyric.) <strong>Spoilers below.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">If Misty from Yellowjackets watched Yellowjackets, you better believe that she'd be on Reddit trying to crack the show's many mysteries. "If she was an audience member of the show, yeah, she would," says Christina Ricci, who isn't Misty, but does play her on TV. "But if she was on the show, she'd realize that there are no answers to be had, no matter how many times you ask the questions!" The show's writers, it seems, would be able to guard spoilers from even their most dogged character.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Misty is an amateur detective, an unflinching fixer, and an excellent murderer. She's also frequently the dispenser of the show's most laugh-out-loud lines, perhaps her most indispensable contribution to a drama built on a dark—sometimes downright scary—premise. And this episode, she got a real showstopper of comic relief. Misty enters a sensory deprivation tank and has a Twin Peaks-tinged vision of her ex-partner in crime Walter (Elijah Wood) and an anthropomorphized version of her pet bird Caligula (John Cameron Mitchell) delivering her affirmations. A far cry, as Ricci points out, from the other adult Yellowjackets' more tortured hallucinations and dream sequences.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But that doesn't mean that Misty's vision didn't tell us something about her character—or how she's learned to cope with the things her younger self did when stranded in the wilderness 20 years ago. For the latest in our weekly Yellowjackets interview series, Ricci gives us insight into the weird world of Misty's psyche, what we've yet to learn about the shifting character dynamics as we approach the season's final act, and then teases a "crazy," "shocking," and "devastating" finale. "It seems like no one suspects what's coming."</p><img alt='christina ricci as misty in yellowjackets, "burial" photo credit colin bentleyshowtime' title=Burial width=2773 height=1849 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/yellowjackets-207-6822-r-64668231bdbbf.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Colin Bentley / Showtime</span></p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Going into this season, what did you know about Misty and her character's trajectory?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, going into this season, I really wasn't told that much about Misty's arc. I knew that she'd be making a friend, I knew Elijah was cast, and I knew what part he was playing. And I don't press for a ton of information. I mean, the writers have a huge burden. This story is so complex, and there's so many main characters, that I just sort of trust and take it script by script.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What did you think when you first read the script for the vision Misty has in the sensory deprivation tank this episode?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Originally, there was a dance number that we did film. All of my dancing was cut out, so I must have been really bad. [laughs] But they used the footage of Elijah dancing—not me!— and added some effects.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was surprising, because lot of the other characters have had these sorts of visions or fantasies and I had wondered if Misty would ever have one. But her character's lack of introspection always made me think that she probably wouldn't. She's not particularly haunted by the past. I don't think that she really feels that she ever did anything wrong. And of course, it's so funny that Misty's is nothing but joyous and affirming when everybody else's fantasy sequences are horrifying and devastating. [laughs] I did think that was so funny and clever. Her version of introspection is not as deep and tortured as the other characters. It's mainly like, "Do you think everyone thinks I'm a bad person?" And then Caligula's like, "No, you're great! Everybody loves you." And she's like, "That's what I thought. I thought I was awesome." It's very apropos for the character.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And what I also love about the sequence and what it ends up meaning for Misty is that she's allowed by her own subconscious to pursue this friendship with Walter. And that gives her very relatable stakes in the subsequent episodes. It actually puts Misty in a place that is a little bit more grounded than the other characters, which is interesting. It's interesting to give Misty, the most out-there character with the least amount of moral quandaries, the most relatable stakes. And now she has something to lose, whereas previously in our story, Misty really has never had that much to lose.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>In the vision, Misty asks Caligula, "When people look at me, do they just see someone desperate for love? Just some murderer?" It was funny to me that those two things—"love" and "murder" were so linked in her head.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because in her mind, those are her only two flaws, you know what I mean? That her only problem! I do think that at this point in her life, Misty does have an intellectual understanding of what her position is in the world and what most people's reactions to her are, and that she's never really going to be accepted on the level that she wants to be. But of course, like everybody, she can't stop those compulsions of wanting the things you never got as a child. Everybody has some hole inside them that they're trying to fill, that they'll never be able to.</p><img alt='l r christina ricci as misty and john cameron mitchell as caligula in yellowjackets, "burial" photo credit colin bentleyshowtime' title=Burial width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/yellowjackets-207-7187-r-646682b82dd87.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Colin Bentley / Showtime</span></p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>In the flashback scenes, Misty coaxes Coach Ben off of a ledge by saying she can't have another death on her hands. But she seems to have less qualms about having deaths on her hand—getting Jessica Roberts out of the picture, covering up Adam Martin's murder—the in the present day.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think that's also incredibly human. We build up these calluses around our deepest wounds to protect us from the things that are painful. And I think Misty is very much someone who's always moved forward. And in order to not feel bad about things she's done, she reframes the way she sees them. I think that's, again, what you're seeing in in her vision too.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>The rest of the adult Yellowjackets treat Misty's murdering with a sort of flippancy too. For example, the scene between Misty and Shauna where Shauna says "I'm very grateful that your hobby seems to be figuring out how to be the perfect serial killer." And Misty's response is, "What does everyone keep saying that to me?"</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, I think what they've experienced in their lives is so extreme, and the more extreme things you witness in life, the less shocked you are by anything.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>That scene, and Misty's reaction, made me laugh out loud. Is the show getting even funnier? Or was it always this funny and I'm just now noticing?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I do feel like a lot of Misty scenes are written to involve a lot of comedy. So from the beginning of season one, I've always been aware that those scenes are funny. But as someone who only works on my scenes and my storyline, I kind of feel like the show is getting scarier! Because when I watched the show, and I see everybody else's storylines, especially the younger cast's storyline, and it just seems so much more frightening than last season!</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Maybe that's what I'm reacting to—the tension of the flashback scenes and the release of the present day scenes.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think that's true because for me, it's the opposite. I'm so used to the comedy that the horror seems even scarier. So as an audience member, I would imagine that's why the other scenes are even funnier—because you're just so desperate for a release.</p><img alt='christina ricci as misty in yellowjackets, "qui" photo credit colin bentleyshowtime' title=Qui width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/yellowjackets-206-5415-r-64668345d86b4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Colin Bentley / Showtime</span></p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a43465781/yellowjackets-season-2-episode-2-melanie-lynskey-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="When I spoke to Melanie" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">When I spoke to Melanie</a>, she mentioned that the cast is full of naturally gifted comedic actors, but that none of you see yourselves as being good at comedy.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's really true that I've never seen myself as a particularly funny actress. But in talking about this a lot while doing press for the show, I realized that I have done a lot of comedy, or at least drama that's heavily tinged with comedy. But the comedy is really in the writing. I don't think any of us go out of our way to be funny, but it's just how well the scripts are written.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>When Misty leaves the sensory deprivation tank, she immediately calls Walter and confesses everything. It reminded me of when she confessed to Crystal at the height of their friendship. Misty is so tactical and guarded, but she makes these leaps of faith when she feels a connection with someone.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, because that phone call comes right after her vision, she feels reassurance that the reaction to her divulging her secrets to Walter will not be the same reaction she got from Crystal. I think that initially, when she left Walter in the car, a lot of that need to get away from him was based on what happened the last time she had a friend who knew who she really was. Her association with friends finding out about her is what happened to Crystal. And so when she has that vision, she's given herself permission to pursue this friendship and to be honest, and reassurance that it will be okay.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You've referred to Misty's relationship with Walter as a "friendship" a few times. But considering the he says "I love you" in Morse code during her vision, she seems to have greater expectations.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That's true, I guess. I suppose. I'm not committing to anything either way!</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What was it like having Elijah come in and play this foil to Misty as someone who is, </strong><strong>in some ways,</strong><strong> so similar to her?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I really I loved working with Elijah. His performance as Walter is just so good and surprising and everything I thought it would be and more. And I think Elijah and I are both the kind of actors who really take in our scene partner and calibrate our performance based on what the other person is doing and giving. In that way, I was so lucky to have someone like him because we were really able to play off each other. It was a fun dynamic to explore because we got to see Misty treat someone else, at least in the beginning of their relationship, in the way that she's normally treated by people.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a43612475/yellowjackets-season-2-episode-4-elijah-wood-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="When I spoke to Elijah" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">When I spoke to Elijah</a>, I told him my theory that he and Misty's relationship would turn adversarial. The show seems to have dropped hints throughout your scenes together: Walter refers to him as the Moriarty to Misty's Sherlock, Walter seems to have a connection to cats while Misty has one to birds, etc. What can you say about where their dynamic is going?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I have to say, I don't have that answer for you. I have absolutely no idea! The conversation I had at the beginning of the season that I was telling you about earlier—that was the last conversation I had about what ultimately happens with Walter and Misty. But I do think this is the kind of show where you have to be worried about everybody. We all think that we're going to get killed off. Everybody. At the end of each season, there's been a moment when all of us have been like, "Do you think...do you think I die? Do you... do you think they're going to kill me?" Everybody! Nobody feels safe. I think as the audience, you shouldn't feel that anyone is safe. But otherwise, I don't have any answers!

When the women are drinking together, Misty says, "That first summer, do you guys remember when we were—" before being interrupted and told nobody wants to reminisce about that time in their lives. Then she says, "No, you don't know what I was going to ask." Do you know what she was going to ask?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yeah, no, I don't. I do not know. [laughs] If I was a more thorough actress, I probably would have asked the writers what Misty was about to say. But I didn't!</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>In the flashbacks, Misty is still aligned with Lottie, but in the present day, Lottie doesn't seem too happy to see Misty on her compound. How do you play those scene knowing that a lot of time has passed between timelines and lot has yet to be revealed about why these dynamics shifted?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yeah, it is hard. And sometimes things are revealed in later episodes, and you think, Oh, I wish I had known that backstory because that would have altered how I played this or that.</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You're not the first cast member to tell me that.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Oh, we've all talked about it at length. But life is messy and complicated, and people have strange reactions to people from their past sometimes, for reasons that have developed over time in their head.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With Lottie, I made sense of in my head this way: obviously there's more to this, obviously more will be revealed. But for the purposes of executing the scenes where I have a negative attitude towards her character, I went with this idea that once they were rescued and everyone started to process what had happened, they somewhat collectively decided that what they had gone through back in the wilderness was all in their heads. They don't seem to be believers in it anymore when we catch up with them in the first season. And Lottie having been committed to an asylum made her an easy scapegoat. I think a person like Misty in that situation would maybe blame her and decide they were all being led astray by this "crazy" person. That's an easy out. So that's how I made sense of Misty's hostility towards her in those scenes, with the information I had at the time. But! There is actually more to it, which I didn't find out for two more episodes.</p><img alt='l r juliette lewis as natalie, melanie lynskey as shauna, tawny cypress as taissa, lauren ambrose as van and christina ricci as misty in yellowjackets, "qui" photo credit colin bentleyshowtime' title=Qui width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/yellowjackets-206-5159-r-6466827342594.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Colin Bentley / Showtime</span><h2 data-node-id=44 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>It definitely seems that the story is barreling towards something big.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've been asking everyone I talk to about the show: do you have any suspicions about anything really dramatic that might happen in the last episode?</p><h2 data-node-id=46 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I have my theories about what will be revealed about the shifting dynamics between the Yellowjackets: that Lottie and Nat will lead the warring factions in the past, and that maybe Nat hasn't drank Lottie's Kool-Aid as much as it seems in the present.
