"Because they connected. And if they were on the fence about it, they never saw anyone in my position take that position and say, 'Look at this. This is a 7-year-old right here. And she might have never made it here.'"</p><p>He added, "So when I talk to my father, my father made me apologize to him for bringing this up publicly. He also said that the abortion culture teaches people that a child isn't a real soul. And it was my wife that said, 'This is a soul.' And the scariest thing is, she had the pills -- you know, you take these pills, you take them and the next morning the baby's gone -- she had the pills in her hand."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d82d0c76-7c53-4fe6-bcd6-42723ec3bea2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:066d2c99-fa02-4f85-93dd-d34646127e84 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/36/5by4/2020/08/25/362482a199104110aa55a791fa0b050f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TooFab/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kanye Needs to Run For Mayor Of Calabasas First Says Michael Blackson (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h4 class=h4>On naming his campaign "Birthday Party"</h4><p>Continuing the topic of abortion, Kanye told Nick that the name for his presidential campaign came as a message in support of pro-life.</p><p>"When I came up with the name of my party, the Birthday Party, it was funny. It was just crazy, it was Ye-zy. I was like, 'That's it!'"</p><p>"I can only give God the glory because of the connection point to the Birthday Party is dealing with life and pro-life," he continued.

Recently, Kanye inked a 10-year deal with Gap for a "Yeezy Gap" line.</p><p>"Virgil, when he went to Louis, that hurt me," he confessed. "Because I was the Louis Vuitton don. I know, I opened the door, but then I wanted to be the Louis Vuitton don!"</p><p>Kanye recalled how he was talking to a representative from Gap who misunderstood him, thinking it was the rapper's dream to be with the Louis Vuitton brand.</p><p>"And I was like, 'No, look how God is. Actually Gap was my dream.' Because I was working at Gap, getting fresh at the Gap, not being able to afford Abercrombie, and getting polos off of layaway at TJ Maxx and Marshalls before I even knew what Louis Vuitton was.

"Every dollar I had. I spent $50 million last year on Sunday Service if you add up the operas, if you add up the flights. It was 120 people going to Jamaica. The Yeezys, they were selling themselves. So instead of paying for ads, I invested it in the church. I invested in spreading gospel. I invested in saying Jesus' name on high."</p><h4 class=h4>On that Taylor Swift moment</h4><p>Kanye infamously interrupted Taylor while she was receiving the Best Female Video award at the 2009 VMAs for "You Belong With Me"; He thought Beyonce should have won for "Single Ladies." Looking back, Kanye said he was guided by God to hijack Taylor.</p><p>"If God ain't want me to run on stage and say Beyonce had the best video, he wouldn't have sat me in the front row," he said. &nbsp;"I would've been sitting in the back and they would've made it the first award and he wouldn't have made it so ridiculous, because I had never heard of this person before and 'Single Ladies' is one of the greatest videos of all time."</p><p>Watch the first part of the interview in its entirety above.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
