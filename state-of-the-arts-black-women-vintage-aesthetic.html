Thanks to Marc Jacobs' <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>pioneering efforts</a> splashing grunge across Perry Ellis' high fashion runway, I learned to compliment rather than match and mix recognizable brands with random-but-carefully-selected secondhand pieces. This approach works because, like time in the pandemic, fashion is an artful but flat circle; it shuttles us around a ferris wheel of styles that resurface again and again through the decades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, if that Yves Saint Laurent gown was pricey back then, it's probably going to be even more exclusive this go around because <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>inflation</a>, baby!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This truth is why Academy Award-winning costume designer Ruth Carter — who built her career dressing actors like Denzel Washington in Spike Lee's period piece Malcolm X and Chadwick Boseman in the afrofuturistic Black Panther — knows vintage shopping is both a treat and a necessity for women who don't have Rihanna's fashion budget.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think we've always been defining personal style with vintage," says Carter of Black women. "I remember Joie Lee walking onto the set of Do The Right Thing, and she had on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vintage 1950s</a> casual cotton dress, and I thought, 'Oh, that's so perfect.' She really stood out from the pack."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Contemporary fashion is a mix of high and low, and the most celebrated looks are old and juxtaposed with something that doesn't seem like it should match at all. Rare finds are the crown jewel of Carter's work, especially when she's digging up garments from bygone eras, like the luxurious mink coat she put on Angela Bassett as Tina Turner in What's Love Got To Do With It, or when she rifled through the basement of an Italian men's store in Brooklyn, to find long-collared shirts for Delroy Lindo — father of that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>everlasting 2020 meme</a> — in Crooklyn, Lee's 1970s coming-of-age story. This ability to tell a story through clothing is part of why Carter is currently serving as an ambassador for the Black woman-owned online platform <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Thrilling</a>, a connector for vintage stores across the country, to share their inventory with television and film costume designers. She dug through those shirt mountains so we don't have to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm so excited to partner with Thrilling, because it aligns with who I was," says Carter, of her knack for finding sartorial needles in haystacks. "For Malcolm X, I traveled to Chicago and bought coats from a vintage collector's old warehouse where there were piles and piles of coats [just for] that scene where Denzel comes out of the movie theater in a zoot suit." In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>her Thrilling edit</a>, you can shop an abstract '90s poncho (a trend that's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>firmly on the comeback</a>), Gucci sneakers, vintage Louboutin pumps, and earrings representing pretty much any decade you'd want to recall, with items starting at $15 and cruising up through the triple digits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Carter's line of work, era-specific clothing is often needed to tell a story, but vintage is enjoying a popular celebrity moment too. It girls like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Zoe Kravitz</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Zendaya</a> are leading the charge and the latter's frequent stylist Law Roach touts a deep personal vintage collection. In 2021, Roach dressed the Euphoria star in a haute couture YSL gown formerly owned by Eunice Johnson, the founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Ebony Fashion Fair cosmetics</a> and took the night at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Essence Black Women In Hollywood event</a>. For the Euphoria premiere this January, Zendaya wore a strapless, black-and-white striped Valentino jumpsuit (pictured at top) first worn by Linda Evangelista in 1992 — a resounding yes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She wears vintage onscreen, too; eagle-eyed fans spotted vintage Jean-Paul Gaultier in an early Season 2 episode when her character, Rue, casually appears in a silk vest. Rue is a perfect example of someone who'd wear something vintage specifically because it's unique, offbeat, and not at all like the sexy twinsets and cutout dresses her classmates were wearing. Something she found, randomly, for a deal or in her mom's closet. Something that wasn't factory-produced to fit one aesthetic we're all drowning in thanks to TikTok.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-more-state-of-the-arts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>More State of the Arts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carter's no stranger to the homogeneity that can happen when fashion folks keep referencing one-another in an endless loop. "Everything looks the same, you know?" she muses. "There's so much bad stuff out there. Once they decide that fuchsia is the color for spring, everything is fuchsia, and it's annoying."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead, if you see a mint condition 1990s No Limit Records jersey long enough to be a dress and feel it would go well without pants along with sparkly, strappy Amina Muaddi stilettos and a Goyard bag in the dead of winter, then congratulations, you have successfully tapped into <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mya's 2000 "Get The Best of Me"</a> look and elevated it. Also congratulations for being literal Rihanna in this recent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>temperature-defying going-out outfit</a>. Like Zendaya's red carpet moments attest, an outfit that reaches back to a pop culture moment and pushes it to another level is stylish brilliance. If inspired to try your own hand at this, check out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>BLK MKT Vintage</a>, an all-encompassing vintage experience that brings Black culture to the fore through archival pieces, clothing, interior decoration, even prop and set design and, yes, they're Black-owned.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An obvious upside to crate-digging for clothes is doing your own small part to reduce waste, but there's also something decentralizing about the rise of vintage shopping and styling. While there are well-reported fashion trends like the 1990s resurgence, including my favorite shade of quirky Daria green, integrating gently used clothing opens up one's imagination. It allows you to circumvent, to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>quote the Devil Wears Prada</a>, "the people in this room," and do your own thing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's what Black and brown people have been doing for ages, whether through our fashion, music, art, food, you name it — think Jean-Michel Basquiat painting on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>actual garbage</a>. We take things that aren't seen as high fashion or desirable and make it fly, so fly that the world chases us for the goods (mass-produces them, and then ruins the fly thing, so we move on to something else). Consider nameplate jewelry, a style popularized on the necks of Black and brown women, which are now central to a slew of Instagram brands that respond in long-winded nos when customers like me ask if their company is Black- or brown-owned. Fashion, like time in this pandemic, is a flat circle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, while most of us are not dressing Tessa Thompson or Lupita Nyong'o for a glamorous movie or gleefully creating an uncolonized Africa, as Ruth E. Carter does with her vintage finds, the second-hand draw is no less strong in everyday life. It's finding the perfect piece that no one else could, for less, an elusive item that proves your style is timeless and it is your own; you supersede brand name and lookbook arrangement — you bring your style to the clothes and not the other way around. It's taking what you see on the runways every February and September, digesting the callbacks to a bygone era, and finding the original for one-third of the price. It is a victory, every time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For those of us who don't have the money to go to Gucci and buy clothing that costs thousands of dollars, we feel comfortable going the vintage route," says Carter. "Everything is cyclical. You can look back and see where the ideas came from and put a look together that's completely now, smarter and fresher, using vintage." Completely now, smarter, and fresher? Sounds about right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The State of the Arts</strong> is InStyle's biannual celebration of the Black creativity and excellence driving fashion, beauty, self-care, and the culture at large.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Credits:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Creative Director: Jenna Brillhart<br>Art Director: Sarah Maiden<br>Illustrator: Kaitlyn Collins<br>Visuals Editor: Kelly Chiello<br>Associate Photo Editor: Amanda Lauro<br>Editorial Director: Laura Norkin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y0wMCtnGanlmLBqbGMmqmtq12XuaKvymauqKWVo3q3tc2tmKCdXZaytMDHnquimw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstate-of-the-arts-black-women-vintage-aesthetic.html&text=Where%20Do%20Black%20Women%20Fit%20in%20the%20Vintage-Clothing%20Revolution%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstate-of-the-arts-black-women-vintage-aesthetic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstate-of-the-arts-black-women-vintage-aesthetic.html&title=Where%20Do%20Black%20Women%20Fit%20in%20the%20Vintage-Clothing%20Revolution%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstate-of-the-arts-black-women-vintage-aesthetic.html&title=Where%20Do%20Black%20Women%20Fit%20in%20the%20Vintage-Clothing%20Revolution%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstate-of-the-arts-black-women-vintage-aesthetic.html&title=Where%20Do%20Black%20Women%20Fit%20in%20the%20Vintage-Clothing%20Revolution%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstate-of-the-arts-black-women-vintage-aesthetic.html&description=Where%20Do%20Black%20Women%20Fit%20in%20the%20Vintage-Clothing%20Revolution%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meet-seth-wunder-million-dollar-listing-la-client-cailins-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Meet Seth Wunder: Million Dollar Listing LA client Cailins husband    Fri 16 December 2022 15:2">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./remember-when-bob-dylan-sued-darius-rucker.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Remember When Bob Dylan Sued Darius Rucker?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
