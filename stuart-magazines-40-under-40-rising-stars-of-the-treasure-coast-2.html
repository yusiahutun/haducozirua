The camp allows children to explore the arts while learning practical skills and character-building techniques. Fontaine provides access to not only the arts at The Lyric Theatre but an escape from everyday life in a medium of artistic expression that elevates and educates. The Fort Pierce resident is also a part of the Downtown Fort Pierce Farmers Market Board of Directors, Heathcote Botanical Garden’s Bonsai Bash Committee and a volunteer for Main Street Fort Pierce Historic Ghost Tours.</p><h3><strong>Elexcia Savarese-Fleming</strong>, 27,&nbsp;Senior Sales Specialist, Teva Pharmaceuticals CNS&nbsp;</h3><p>Growing up, Elexcia Savarese-Fleming was an avid teen performer at StarStruck Theatre where she spent most of her after-school hours, weekends and summers. She also worked at the theatre for a year after graduating before taking on the role as a senior sales specialist at Teva Pharmaceuticals CNS. Her proudest accomplishment to date has been winning two top five percent titles in the three years she’s been in the President’s Club (top 10 percent in sales) and, at press time, was on pace to finish again in the top five percent for 2019. Savarese-Fleming married her high school sweetheart, Brooks, which she says reminds her “how rewarding it is coming from a town on the Treasure Coast.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/01/1stuart_magazines_40_under_40_group_8_1.png><h3><strong>Angela Hoffman</strong>, 35,&nbsp;Chief Advancement Officer, Boys & Girls Club of Martin County&nbsp;</h3><p>While she previously helped grow the Hobe Sound Chamber of Commerce financially and in its&nbsp;geographic reach, Angela Hoffman’s latest achievement has been holding the title of chief advancement officer for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Martin County. Recently, she helped secure funding for a food truck culinary program that is set to launch this summer, which will&nbsp;utilize the produce growing in local Boys and Girls Club gardens. “Advancing these initiatives, garnering community support and helping our team design creative solutions to respond to the changing needs of our members is by far the most exciting part of my position,” Hoffman says. She’s excited to&nbsp;continue accelerating the work of the&nbsp;Business Development Board to&nbsp;strengthen Martin County’s economy while serving as the president. When not working, Hoffman enjoys family time at the beach as well as&nbsp;attending parades and the Festival of the Arts.</p><h3><strong>Sam Bruning</strong>, 38,&nbsp;Owner/Financial Advisor, Southern Magnolia Investment Management</h3><p>As the owner and financial advisor for his own business, Southern Magnolia Investment Management, Sam Bruning runs its day-to-day operations. Doing so has been a step outside of his comfort zone after working at Fortune 500 companies for 15 years. Despite his career switch, one constant has been his life on the Treasure Coast for more than 30 years. “The things I enjoy most about the Treasure Coast are the close friends I have made since moving here in 1987, the weather, the history, the food and restaurants, the economy and the great people I meet on a daily basis,” Bruning says.</p><h3><strong>Mike Meier</strong>, 33,&nbsp;Mayor, City of Stuart; Director, Farm Operations for CoLab Farms</h3><p>At press time, Mike Meier was recently elected as the Mayor of Stuart, making him the city’s youngest in 63 years.
