All I got in return was loneliness.</li><li>It had taken me a moment to give my all to you, but you ruined my trust and played with my fragile heart.</li><li>You brought me so many smiles that I never once thought you would bring me so many tears.</li><li>It hurts the most when the person who made you feel so special yesterday is the same person who has made you feel so unwanted today.</li><li>I'm not in the mood to talk to you right now. Please give me some space.</li><li>I can't deny the fact that I'm in pain, and it's affecting me deeply. I often feel like crying, but it won't still solve anything.</li><li>My heart has been broken, stabbed, and hurt, but it is still functional. I hope it can carry the sadness in its pocket and move on.</li><li>If you could read my mind, you would be in tears from knowing how much you hurt me.</li><li>I don't care if you cheated on me because it's not as near as bad as how you made me feel about myself.</li><li>Being ignored in love is the worst feeling ever.</li><li>Do you know how badly you hurt me? I cried so much because of you, and you didn't care about my tears.</li><li>My feelings and my life, you have completely mocked. In agony and pain, I hope that your heart is forever locked. This text message is to let you know I hate you.</li><li>You should get an Academy Award for being the best male actor of the year. Not once did I realize that you were cheating on me. I hate you.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6436f018b847e456.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ online friendship quotes for long-distance friends</span></p></a><h3 id=439637-a-letter-to-boyfriend-expressing-hurt-feelings class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>A letter to boyfriend expressing hurt feelings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c47b29091fa42a56.png><p class=align-left>You can also write a letter to your boyfriend and express how intensely he hurt you. Below are samples of <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/424825-deep-emotional-love-letters-cry.html href=#>emotional paragraphs</a> you can add to your letter to make him feel bad for hurting you:</p><ul><li>I felt hurt. You broke me to pieces. Not because of what you did but because you did it. I never expected you to be the one to treat me that way.</li><li>I always thought we both made a cute couple â€“ like two fish in a bowl. I didn't know that your name was selfish.</li><li>You knew I was in a bad place, yet you said such awful things that might scare me forever. That was the first time I wanted to break up with you.</li><li>I hope that every tear that drops from my cheeks becomes the karma that comes around and crushes your happiness again and again.</li><li>Why should I even bother taking you back if you didn't think twice before getting into another woman's sack? I hate you for being so ruthless and heartless.</li><li>Your words keep echoing inside my head, destroying me repeatedly. I wanted to put my mental health first and drive you out of my life.</li><li>The void you have left in my life would rather be empty than be filled with thoughts of a spineless person like you.</li><li>I thought:" How will I ever care for myself properly when I have someone like this? How will I ever become better if he keeps reminding me of everything I did wrong?"</li><li>All I wanted was for you to love me and hug me tightly when my world fell apart. Instead, you were the one to make it fall apart.</li><li>No matter where I am, what I am doing, or how old I become â€“ I will always hate you for breaking my heart and hurting my feelings.</li><li>Our breakup took me by surprise. It brought tears to my eyes. You have left me speechless. You have robbed my happiness. While I salvage my heart together, I hope yours rots forever. I hate you.</li><li>I know what I'm guilty of. I'm not afraid to take responsibility for my actions. Aren't we all guilty? Does that mean I am less deserving of love?</li><li>My heart is pink â€“ bubbly, innocent, alive, and throbbing with love. Yours is black â€“ deceiving, manipulative, unreliable, and full of evil.</li><li>Moving on from a loser like you will be easy, but healing the scars of being betrayed by you will be difficult. I hate you.</li><li>Our breakup is bitter-sweet. Bitter because you broke my heart and humiliated my love. Sweet, because I'm glad I found out your cheating ways sooner rather than later.</li><li>I gave you my heart to love it, not crush it. I gave you my body to embrace it, not to humiliate it. I gave you my soul to cherish it, not kill it.</li><li>I am drowning in a pool of misery, but I'd rather die than be saved by you.</li><li>I never imagined that your voice, once music to my ears, would one day be the knife in my heart.</li><li>The scary part is not that you cheated on me while you were my boyfriend. It is what more you would have done had I not caught you. I hate you.</li><li>You said you would be mine to the last day of your life! You said you love me crazily, and nothing in the world can take you away from me! Now, those commitments make me laugh.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec4a0844d70153f2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30+ heart touching thank you messages for your best friend</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b32cc182c8b7465d.png><h3 id=439637-how-do-i-write-a-hurtful-message-to-my-boyfriend class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>How do I write a hurtful message to my boyfriend?</h3><p class=align-left>To avoid breeding disastrous misunderstandings in your relationship when communicating your dissatisfaction via texts, text when both of you are calm.
