Upon its release 20 years ago, it became the center of a moment when the world began to give the country’s filmmakers their due; Oldboy won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and made notable inroads at the U.S. box office. But it wasn’t the only South Korean film from 2003 to find success: Oldboy, Memories of Murder, and A Tale of Two Sisters were all released within a few months of each other — all three stylistically and narratively distinct but indelibly linked by international borders. Where any of them succeeded, the others were there to reward viewers looking to dive deeper into the nation’s films.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnah4g34000v3b7h7sbnwd5v@published data-word-count=81>The subsequent 20 years, a period sometimes referred to as the “<a href=#>South Korean Film Renaissance</a>,” have seen many breakthrough moments for South Korean films and shows.

In the hotel room that has been converted into a prison, he discovers his wife has been murdered and he’s the primary suspect. That becomes a secondary concern, however, as he’s imprisoned for the next 15 years, fed through a dog door with no one to talk to. Just as mysteriously as he was taken, he’s released and finds he has five days to unravel the mystery of his imprisonment. That’s just the first act. The story barrels forward like a runaway train full of horrors that makes Oldboy a delightfully unique, almost unbearably brutal experience. It’s also just one-third of Park’s Vengeance trilogy — Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Lady Vengeance are also excellent.</p>Buy on Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnahe5pg004x3b7higdcnbqy@published>Memories of Murder</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnahc1km002g3b7h3i4m8j1u@published data-word-count=7><strong>Year:</strong> 2003<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 2h 12m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Bong Joon Ho</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnahed2h00563b7hp6o1sh2z@published data-word-count=118>Bong Joon Ho’s early classic is a tense detective story with a muted palette that makes the detectives feel like they’re alone in a world gone mad. Two bumbling small-town police officers (Song Kang-ho and Kim Roe-ha) are joined by an officer from Seoul (Kim Sang-kyung) to investigate the ritualistic murder of women in a small South Korean town. Based on a true story of murders in the 1980s, Bong displays his mastery at balancing brutality and black humor, and eventually, the psychological damage of the murders takes its toll on both the audience and the characters. The world, Memories of Murder seems to say, cannot find a way to deal with the violent depravity it faces here.</p>Rent on Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnahexxn006d3b7hk34wbv3n@published>A Tale of Two Sisters</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnahemti005n3b7h5vjxctk7@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year:</strong> 2003<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 1h 54m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Kim Jee-woon</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnahemti005q3b7hbyp5cx24@published data-word-count=98>Sisters Soo-mi (Lim Soon-jung) and Soo-yeon (Moon Geun-young) return to their countryside home after time spent in a psychiatric hospital. The idyllic setting is supposed to bring them peace, but confrontations with their stepmother (Yum Jung-ah) make that an unachievable goal. The sisters endure a series of mysterious incidents that become increasingly nightmarish as director Kim Jee-woon sprints toward a dark and unexpected conclusion.

Yet, in the rich tradition of monster movies, there’s an allegory at the heart of the story of this slimy, tentacled, child-snatching monster living along the Han River. Gang Doo, played by Bong regular Song Kang-ho, leads his family on a mission to save his daughter from the clutches of the creature. Like <a href=#>Godzilla</a> before it, the real monster at the heart of the film is humanity.</p>Stream on Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnahx8o500883b7j3kt2zy43@published>Secret Sunshine</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnahupj9001w3b7jgbreu6vx@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year:</strong> 2007<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 2h 22m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Lee Chang-dong</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnahwzfu007v3b7jhd60jxgo@published data-word-count=95>Secret Sunshine is the kind of film that people call lyrical.

When her son is kidnapped and murdered, she’s left to mourn the loss of everything she used to define herself, struggling to find meaning in the wake of such a stunning loss.

It’s a slow-burning story about the murder of a teenage girl. Kim Hye-ja stars as the unnamed mother of an intellectually disabled boy suspected of the murder. She starts her own investigation into the crime, putting the terrifying depths of unconditional love on display. The mother’s investigation puts her in morally compromising situations where she makes decisions that leave viewers screaming at the screen.

Song Kang-ho plays a depressed priest who begins to experience odd symptoms after volunteering to test a vaccine. He fears sunlight and has an overwhelming desire to feed on patients at the hospital where he attends to the dying. The changes aren’t just physiological, though. He falls in love with a childhood friend’s wife (Kim Ok-bin).

On the surface, it’s a simple story: The melancholic film follows the elderly Mija (Yoon Jeong-hee), a caretaker who lives with her grandson. She is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and chooses to learn something new as she is faced with the terror of forgetting her own life. She joins a community learning poetry, learning to express herself as she loses a sense of self and even language itself.

What follows is a series of double-crosses and subterfuge that runs almost impossibly deep.</p>Stream on Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnai95xa00l23b7jeykc011v@published>The Fortress</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnai8tls00ki3b7jdlar02v1@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year:</strong> 2017<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 2h 20m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Hwang Dong-hyuk</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnai8tls00kl3b7j2bhenpnj@published data-word-count=100>Less heralded internationally than many on this list — possibly because of a somewhat ham-fisted finale — The Fortress is a gorgeous 17th-century epic about King Injo (Park Hae-il) of Joseon (Korea) holed up in a fortress against an overwhelming Qing invasion. Between stunning cinematography and a moody, minimalist score by the legendary late composer <a href=#>Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>, it’s an emotional journey. Like most war epics, there’s a strong thread about sacrifice. Yet it approaches the topic with a distinctly modern sensibility, spending much of its run time debating who it is that must sacrifice and what it means to lead.</p>Stream on Netflix <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Netflix</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnaiabfi00ma3b7j00on84wx@published>Burning</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaia61e00m03b7jl6tm53we@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year: </strong>2018<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 2h 28m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Lee Chang-dong</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaia61f00m33b7jk42539yx@published data-word-count=111>It was eight years between Poetry and Lee Chang-dong’s next film, a contemplative adaptation of Haruki Murakami’s short story “Barn Burning.” Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in) runs into an old childhood friend, Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo). They hook up just before she takes a trip to Africa. Jong-su cat-sits for her, masturbating and thinking of her in her apartment. She returns to South Korea with Ben (Steven Yeun), a man she met during a harrowing experience abroad. As the three spend time together, Ben reveals that he has a disturbing hobby, and every moment of their time together is so loaded with tension, viewers are left wondering when and how the dam will burst.</p>Stream on Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnaiccws00op3b7jipfzsax6@published>Parasite</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaibry800no3b7jepausaeb@published data-word-count=7><strong>Year:</strong> 2019<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 2h 12m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Bong Joon Ho</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaibzzc00o03b7j6f07ja55@published data-word-count=86>With his <a href=#>seventh feature</a>, Bong Joon Ho made history. Parasite was the <a href=#>first non-English-language film</a> to win an Oscar for Best Picture, forcing many Americans to overcome their fear of tiny words at the bottom of a screen. Bong demonstrates a masterful ability to build tension as the destitute Kim family gloms onto the wealthy Park family, slowly getting each family member a job in the Park household. Parasite oscillates from tragicomedy to thriller and back again, leaving no one unscarred by living in this world.</p>Stream on Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnaidh3700pp3b7jopygrdsl@published>The Gangster, The Cop, The Devil</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaid3rw00oz3b7jvcz6u2k8@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year:</strong> 2019<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 1h 49m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Lee Won-tae</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaido8400pz3b7je19t9l7d@published data-word-count=107>This dark thriller is based on the true story of a serial killer, played by Kim Sung-kyu, striking out at random victims. The killer’s hallmark is rear-ending cars at night and stabbing the driver to death when they get out to assess the damage. However, he makes the mistake of rear-ending a mob boss played by Don Lee. Everyone is forced to compromise their values as a rogue cop (Kim Mu-yeol) works with the mob boss to hunt the killer. While they cooperate, there’s a race to find the mysterious killer, as their deal stipulates that whoever catches him gets to deal with him however they’d like.</p>Stream on Peacock <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Peacock</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnaiejx400qs3b7jhrq0t28g@published>Decision to Leave</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaiedqy00qh3b7jerfk4n2s@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year:</strong> 2022<br><strong>Runtime: </strong>2h 19m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Park Chan-wook</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaiedqz00qk3b7j4vz3sqhx@published data-word-count=87>Park Chan-wook’s latest is arguably his most emotional film. It’s been compared to Basic Instinct, though you’d have to couch that by saying it’s Basic Instinct plus Park. An insomniac cop (Park Hae-il) investigates the death of a wealthy man whose wife, a Chinese immigrant named Seo-rae (Tang Wei), tops the list of suspects. The mystery is engrossing, but the heart of the film is the messy web of personal entanglement that develops between the two. It comes to a masterfully shocking ending that feels distinctively Park.</p>Stream on Mubi <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Mubi</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnaifojp00s13b7jhlmjhslt@published>﻿The Roundup</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaifim000rq3b7jdtmvgd32@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year:</strong> 2022<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 1h 46m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Lee Sang-yong</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaifim000rt3b7j8r62xkla@published data-word-count=93>American audiences will recognize star Don Lee, who has crossed the Pacific in films like Marvel’s Eternals. The Roundup, the second film of the Crime City series, shows what Lee is best known for. He plays a gruff, aloof detective who discovers South Koreans taking up residence in Vietnam to commit violent crimes against South Korean tourists. While a tale of a cop taking the law into his own hands should, at a minimum, raise an eyebrow (and it does here), Lee is a powerful, mesmerizing vortex at the center of the film.</p>Stream on Tubi <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Tubi</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnaih1zx00tl3b7jzl3ffyn3@published>Past Lives</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaiearz00q83b7jqarhr399@published data-word-count=6><strong>Year:</strong> 2023<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 1h 45m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Celine Song</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnaigtxo00te3b7joyrubgf5@published data-word-count=82>Past Lives is the impressive directorial debut from Celine Song. It follows the relationship of two childhood friends over the course of more than two decades. They grow apart in their relationship and are physically separated, living across the globe. They reconnect years later, but find that their lives can’t quite meet. After another stretch of time, they connect again and find themselves exploring what the distance between them has meant in a beautiful, emotionally challenging film that is semi-autobiographical for Song.</p>Rent on Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjpt4k1ny0028usy6lvhd7oen@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>15 Great Movies to Get You Started With South Korean Horror</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck66l7yhg0033sdy638bcccz5@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The House That Parasite Built (From Scratch)</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ambrose-130eeadcb74a3983eb7e65b99c2cba7b@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Differences Between Spike Lee’s <i>Oldboy</i> and the Original <i>Oldboy</i></span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Where to Stream the Best of South Korea’s Film Renaissance</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyjsdKtZKSnopqur3nMqK2inaNiwLW%2BxJqkoqaXY7W1ucs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-korean-movies-streaming-html.html&text=Where%20to%20Stream%20the%20Best%20of%20the%20South%20Korean%20Film%20Renaissance&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-korean-movies-streaming-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-korean-movies-streaming-html.html&title=Where%20to%20Stream%20the%20Best%20of%20the%20South%20Korean%20Film%20Renaissance" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-korean-movies-streaming-html.html&title=Where%20to%20Stream%20the%20Best%20of%20the%20South%20Korean%20Film%20Renaissance" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-korean-movies-streaming-html.html&title=Where%20to%20Stream%20the%20Best%20of%20the%20South%20Korean%20Film%20Renaissance" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-korean-movies-streaming-html.html&description=Where%20to%20Stream%20the%20Best%20of%20the%20South%20Korean%20Film%20Renaissance" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cardi-b-responds-nude-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cardi B Responds After Accidentally Leaking Her Own Nude Photos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ufc-charles-oliveira-wants-knock-conor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="UFC: Charles Oliveira wants to knock Conor McGregor out and make Nate Diaz tap in the sa">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
