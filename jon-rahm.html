Rahm trailed 54-hole leader <a href=#>Robert Rock</a> by five shots heading into the final 18 holes of the tournament. Beginning the round at eight-under overall, Rahm registered four birdies on the front nine to make the turn at 11-under overall and three-under 31 for the day. The 2017 Irish Open champion then shot five-under 31 on the back nine, including four birdies and an eagle, to close out the two-stroke victory.</p><p>On 6 October 2019, Rahm won his second consecutive Open de España at Club de Campo in Madrid. Rahm entered the final round with a five-shot lead and maintained that advantage with a final round 66, 5-under, to finish on 22 under 262.</p><p>On 24 November 2019, Rahm won the season-long Race to Dubai title on the European Tour with a victory at the DP World Tour Championship, Dubai. He also won the European Tour Golfer of the Year award.</p><p>He is a keen supporter of the Basque football team Athletic Bilbao, and was honoured as the club's special guest at a game in December 2019.</p><p>Rahm started 2018 by finishing runner-up eight strokes behind <a href=#>Dustin Johnson</a> at the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Kapalua, Hawaii.</p><p>In April 2018, Rahm won the Open de España on the European Tour.</p><p>On 2 December 2018, Rahm won limited-field Hero World Challenge tournament in the Bahamas.</p><p>Rahm lives in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2018, he became engaged to long time college girlfriend Kelley Cahill. In December 2019 Rahm and Cahill married. His nickname is Rahmbo.</p><p>In late January 2017, Rahm won the Farmers Insurance Open with a 60-foot eagle putt on the final hole to notch his maiden PGA Tour title. He jumped from 137th to 46th in the Official World Golf Ranking with the win, and also gained entry into the Masters Tournament, The Players Championship, the PGA Championship, and World Golf Championships events. On 2 March, Rahm played in his first World Golf Championships event at the WGC-Mexico Championship where he shot rounds of 67-70-67-68 (−12) to finish T3, two strokes behind winner <a href=#>Dustin Johnson</a>.</p><p>Rahm won the DP World Tour Championship, Dubai, the final event of the 2017 European Tour season. He was awarded the European Tour Rookie of the Year for finishing as the highest-ranked rookie in the Race to Dubai. However, his award caused a stir among fellow European Tour pros, who felt that it should've gone to a more committed member of the tour. Outside the majors and WGCs, Rahm had played just four regular season European Tour events.</p><p>In September 2018, Rahm qualified for the European team participating in the 2018 Ryder Cup. The European team won the Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. 17 1/2 to 10 1/2 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.</p><p>After the U.S. Open, Rahm turned professional, which meant that he forfeited his exemption into the 2016 Open Championship. The next week Rahm played in his first event as a pro at the Quicken Loans National. He held or shared the lead for the first two rounds and finished tied for third place, four strokes behind the winner, <a href=#>Billy Hurley III</a>. The finish was enough for Rahm to regain entry into The Open, as the Quicken Loans National was part of the Open Qualifying Series. Rahm finished tied runner-up in the RBC Canadian Open, securing Special Temporary Member status for the remainder of the season. He gained enough points as a non-member to earn a PGA Tour card for 2017.</p><p>Rahm was an amateur through the 2016 U.S. Open.</p><p>Note that there is double counting of starts, wins, finishes and money for majors and WGC tournaments between the PGA Tour and European Tour stats. ^ Rahm was an amateur through the 2016 U.S. Open. * As of the 2019 season</p><p>Rahm won the Ben Hogan Award in 2015 and 2016, the first player to win it twice. He was also the leading individual at the 2014 Eisenhower Trophy. He competed in the 2015 Phoenix Open as an amateur during his junior year, finishing tied for fifth place, three shots behind the winner. On 1 April 2015, Rahm became the 28th player to be the No. 1-ranked golfer in the World Amateur Golf Ranking. His first stint was for 25 consecutive weeks, after which he surrendered it, regained it, and held it for an additional 35 weeks. His total of 60 weeks spent atop the ranking is the all-time record. While ranked No. 1 in the world, he advanced to the quarterfinals of the 2015 U.S. Amateur before losing to <a href=#>Derek Bard</a>.</p><p>He won the Mark H. McCormack Medal in 2015 as the leading player in the World Amateur Golf Ranking, which qualified him for the following year's U.S. Open and Open Championship. He closed out his collegiate career by winning the Pac-12 Conference championship and an NCAA regional championship before finishing tied for third in the national championship. He was the low amateur at the 2016 U.S. Open, finishing his final tournament as an amateur in a tie for 23rd place at 7-over-par.</p><p>Later in the month, Rahm won the CareerBuilder Challenge after a sudden death playoff with <a href=#>Andrew Landry</a>, for his second career PGA Tour victory. After matching scores on the first three extra holes, Rahm prevailed with a birdie on the fourth extra hole. The win lifted Rahm to a career high 2nd in the world rankings. This made it four wins in just 38 professional starts for Rahm – a ratio bettered only by Tiger Woods in the past 30 years.</p><p>Jon Rahm Rodríguez (born 10 November 1994) is a Spanish professional golfer. Rahm was the number one golfer in the World Amateur Golf Ranking for a record 60 weeks and was the low amateur at the 2016 U.S. Open, after which he turned professional. Rahm won three times in 2017, once on the PGA Tour and two Rolex Series event on the European Tour and reached a career-high ranking of No. 2 in the world after winning the CareerBuilder Challenge in January 2018.</p><p>Rahm finished tied for 27th place in his first Masters and then finished 4th in the Wells Fargo Championship and joint runner-up in the Dean & DeLuca Invitational, results which lifted him into the top-10 of the World Rankings. Making his debut in a European Tour event, he finished tied for 10th in the Open de France and, the following week, he earned his first European Tour victory by winning the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open by six strokes.</p><p>Rahm's surname originates from a Swiss ancestor who moved to Spain in the 1820s; his mother is from Madrid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfn7yvedGan6Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjon-rahm.html&text=Jon%20Rahm%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjon-rahm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjon-rahm.html&title=Jon%20Rahm%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjon-rahm.html&title=Jon%20Rahm%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjon-rahm.html&title=Jon%20Rahm%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjon-rahm.html&description=Jon%20Rahm%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./trisha-paytas-strips-worlds-skimpiest-20857214.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trisha Paytas strips to world's skimpiest lingerie amid bitter Gabbie Hanna feud">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jelly-roll-new-tattoo-wife-bunnie-xo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jelly Roll's New Tattoo Has a Special Significance">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
