Her commitment to grooming her children the right way is certainly paying off.</strong></p><p>Tamera Mowry has been open about her take on parenting, from her decision to become a mom to her many meltdowns throughout her parenting journey.</p><p>Her transparency as a mom almost makes parenting seem fun. Hence, when the actress revealed she had no plans to have more children, it surprised many.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Thankfully, the star <a href=#>explained</a> her stance, saying parenting was hard work and entailed more than looking cute on cameras depicting special milestones in the child’s life.</p><p>Going further, the icon took a dive into the challenges of motherhood and how looking out for her kids sometimes drives her to the breaking point.</p><p>While most moms can relate to Tamera’s plight, many can’t help wondering how many kids it takes to drive an award-winning superstar, actress, singer, wife, sibling, and mom to tears.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Kids_Does_Tamera_Mowry_Have></span><strong>How Many Kids Does Tamera Mowry Have?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tamera Mowry is a mother to two <a href=#>children</a>, including son Aden John Tanner and daughter Ariah Talea. The two youngsters came from her marriage to Fox News correspondent Adam Housley.</p><p>As a mom of two,&nbsp; the actress has managed to find a rhythm to keep her family going. Her kids, aged 6 and 9, respectively, have grown to understand their parent’s professions and aspire to become like them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Tamera Mowry once opened up about her kids’ reaction to her movies and TV shows, saying they loved watching her. The two youngsters especially enjoyed watching their mom on her infamous sitcom “Sister, Sister,” where she starred alongside twin sister Tia Mowry-Hardrict.</p><p>Their love for their mom’s onscreen works has inspired Aden and Ariah to nurse acting dreams, and their parents couldn’t be prouder.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Aden_John_Tanner_Is_A_Doting_Elder_Brother></span><strong>Aden John Tanner Is A Doting Elder Brother</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tia and Tamera Mowry both became parents in their early thirties, welcoming two children, each with their respective spouses. While Tia became a mom in 2011 following the birth of her son Cree Taylor, her sister followed suit soon after.</p><p>The actress’ son, Aden John, born in 2012, has since grown into an adorable young chap with diverse interests. In addition to his acting dreams, Aden seems to have the ultimate sense of humor, has a knack for the culinary arts, and enjoys cooking.</p><p>During one of her interviews, Tamera <a href=#>admitted</a> the young lad was following the footsteps of her and Housley, who both loved to cook.</p><p>Over the pandemic, he got more involved in cooking. He eventually picked up enough skills to whip up some breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Sounds like a keeper!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ariah_Talea_Is_A_Budding_Actress></span><strong>Ariah Talea</strong> <strong>Is A Budding Actress</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Three years after Aden blessed his parents with his arrival, Mowry welcomed daughter Ariah Talea. The starlet, born in July 2015 seems to already have her ambitions laid out.</p><p>Like her brother, she enjoys cooking, having participated in her mom’s social media show, “Quarantine Cuisine,” during the pandemic. Additionally, she continues nurturing her acting skills in hopes of someday appearing onscreen like her famous mom.</p><p>The mom of two admitted to spotting her 6-year-old acting in front of the mirror on occasions. Ariah also constantly requests to be in her mom’s next movie.</p><p>Having witnessed her daughter’s zeal, Tamera Mowry resolved to someday put the youngster in one of her movies and gear off her dream career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Tamera_Mowry_Plan_To_Have_More_Kids></span><strong>Does Tamera Mowry Plan To Have More Kids?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Tamera Mowry has made no secret of the fact that she was done having kids, she has not entirely ruled out the possibility of expanding her family.</p><p>The “Sister, Sister” star once <a href=#>opened up</a> about her intentions to add one more to her brood through adoption. According to her, adoption was a concept she always favored right from her childhood.</p><p>Mowry revealed that God placed the idea of someday adopting a child in her heart when she was eleven. Upon relaying the dream to Housley, the news correspondent admitted to having the same aspirations.</p><p>With the couple in sync with the decision, the icon’s family would certainly experience an increase in size soon. But, like she rightly said, “timing is everything.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tamera_Mowrys_Husband></span><strong>Tamera Mowry’s Husband</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Addam Housley is <a href=#>Tamera Mowry’s husband</a> and father to her two children. The two tied the knot in 2011 and have lived in marital bliss ever since.</p><p>Like his wife, who now goes by the moniker Tamera Mowry-Housley since their union, Housley has a career in the entertainment industry.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He once played professional baseball and served as a Fox news correspondent following his retirement from the games. After two decades as a correspondent, Housley turned his focus to entrepreneurship, running his family business, Century Oak Winery, in Acampo, California.</p><p>He also co-owns the tasting room, Housley Napa Valley, alongside his wife of over a decade and contributes actively to grooming their kids into responsible adults.</p><p>Tamera Mowry’s kids grow by leaps and bounds, priming up to uphold their parents’ acting legacies. Yet, even as youngsters, the duo undoubtedly understand the value of family, one trait <a href=#>the Mowrys have in common</a> and have utilized as a superpower throughout their Hollywood journey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktbDDjKaYp7FdoLalv4ytmKadopZ6rrvWq7BmpZWawW6uxJqsraGWqrlussCmoKWxXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-many-kids-tamera-mowry-meet-beautiful-family.html&text=How%20Many%20Kids%20Does%20Tamera%20Mowry%20Have%3f%20Meet%20the%20Actress%27s%20Beautiful%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-many-kids-tamera-mowry-meet-beautiful-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-many-kids-tamera-mowry-meet-beautiful-family.html&title=How%20Many%20Kids%20Does%20Tamera%20Mowry%20Have%3f%20Meet%20the%20Actress%27s%20Beautiful%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-many-kids-tamera-mowry-meet-beautiful-family.html&title=How%20Many%20Kids%20Does%20Tamera%20Mowry%20Have%3f%20Meet%20the%20Actress%27s%20Beautiful%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-many-kids-tamera-mowry-meet-beautiful-family.html&title=How%20Many%20Kids%20Does%20Tamera%20Mowry%20Have%3f%20Meet%20the%20Actress%27s%20Beautiful%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-many-kids-tamera-mowry-meet-beautiful-family.html&description=How%20Many%20Kids%20Does%20Tamera%20Mowry%20Have%3f%20Meet%20the%20Actress%27s%20Beautiful%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lisa-marie-presley-grandmother-riley-keough-daughter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lisa Marie Presley Became a Grandmother to a Baby Girl Last Year">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./eric-dane-wife-sue-over-threesome-sex-tape.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eric Dane and Wife Sue Over Threesome Sex Tape">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
