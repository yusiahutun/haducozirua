Whether it’s a ring that was passed down to you or a pair of earrings that you feel no longer suit your style, it’s very common to hold on to jewellery that you don’t actually wear but refuse to give away, often because it holds sentimental value. But, just as with our wardrobes, it is great to make more of what you already own and invest in that, turning something that is gathering dust into a piece that you cherish daily, and this is particularly easy to do when it comes to jewels.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There is no point owning jewellery that sits in a drawer never to be worn, simply because the style isn’t quite right for you,” says <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.emmacwebb.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emma Clarkson Webb" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emma Clarkson Webb</a>, a London designer who specialises in diamonds and semi-precious stones, and who often helps clients turn old heirlooms into something more fitting for them. “We find that a lot of people are nervous about redesigning vintage pieces because they feel that they are parting with the history attached to the piece, as well as its sentimentality, but this is wrong. We can still create something new and beautiful while respecting the original.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In fact, with so many different options available for repurposing jewellery, you can change as much or as little as you like, holding on to certain sentimental aspects, while still making the piece more appropriate for you.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When it comes to reworking heirlooms into new jewellery, sometimes, we just update the piece, creating a more modern and wearable version of the existing design,” says jeweller <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rachelboston.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rachel Boston" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rachel Boston</a>. “With other projects, we’ll do a complete transformation where we reuse the gemstones and metal, and can also supplement with newly sourced gemstones, depending on our client’s chosen design direction.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And of course, even if you are completely reworking the piece, you can still pay tribute to the original, copying the stone settings or engravings, or even adding new elements that gently nod to its history, which is a great option if you are worried about losing that sentimental nature of the design. Either way though, creating something that you will cherish rather than leaving it as is to sit in a drawer for years, is a great way to honour the jewellery and whoever or whatever it reminds you of.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I hate the idea of these precious pieces sitting unloved and unworn in a safe, when it can become anything you want it to be – it is treasure to be cherished, and enjoyed as often as possible,” says Olivia Young, founder of luxury jewellery label <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ouroborosjewellery.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ouroboros class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ouroboros</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And, there are so many other benefits to repurposing an old piece of jewellery rather than buying something brand new, the primary one being how cost effective it is, particularly if you are going to use all elements of the original piece. Eliminating the need for many, if any, other materials means you are only paying for the design fees and production costs, which of course hugely knocks the price down of your bespoke piece of jewellery, and perhaps makes this option affordable to you for the first time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The other clear advantage of reusing materials is regarding the environmental impact of your new piece of jewellery. Making the most of stones and metal which have already been manufactured is a much more sustainable option than starting from scratch. There are far fewer environmental costs when you’re not sourcing stones from mines, while you are also eliminating many of the environmental transport costs, which you would have with something brand new.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The process of resetting stones can also be a fun, creative one, giving you the opportunity to create something totally unique to you. “These type of projects are some of our favourite jobs,” says Boston. “It’s a great creative challenge to breathe a new lease of life into an old piece, and working with such sentimental objects is such a pleasure.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are also advantages to creating something bespoke with a vintage stone, rather than something brand new, Boston explains. “Vintage gemstones have real character – and having a contrast between older and newer cuts can be really subtle and elegant.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Antique stones were usually hand cut so they will be irregular in shape but with deep backs and interesting characteristics,” adds designer <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.jessiethomasjewellery.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jessie Thomas" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jessie Thomas</a>. “They aren’t perfect but that’s why they are interesting and worth reusing.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, if you have a piece of jewellery that you want repurposed, you may be wondering what kinds of things can be done – and, the possibilities may surprise you.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Your options are pretty much limitless in terms of what you can create,” explains jewellery designer <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://sophiekeegan.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sophie Keegan" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sophie Keegan</a>, who remembers creating a set of rings from a client’s brooch, which had been passed down from her grandmother. “Once the stones are removed and the gold has been melted down, you have a completely fresh start to create your dream piece of jewellery.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you have a ring that you want turned into earrings or a necklace, this is easy too, explains Young: “Depending on the number of gems, it can nearly always be turned into something else – sometimes this requires sourcing matching gemstones or creating clever designs to make it work, but it is always possible.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meanwhile, if you are not actually a fan of the shape of the gemstone, this too can be completely altered (which is also a great option if it is damaged or chipped). “If you have an old stone that could be polished up or maybe even reshaped, this is always really interesting,” says <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://minkajewels.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Minka Jewels" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Minka Jewels</a> founder, Lucy Crowther. “I work with a brilliant stone cutter so it’s always fun thinking about how we can change it slightly.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While any gemstone can be used, the easiest pieces to repurpose are large stones, explains Thomas: “They are quick to remove, and the value is often held in the large stone over multiple small ones.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s also important to remember that you don’t have to repurpose all the stones in one go,” she says. “I think people get stuck on that a lot; you can pick and choose what you take out to use in a new design, sometimes it will just be one stone, and then you can keep all the others for another piece in the future.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ultimately, whether you want to do a little or a lot of change, it’s important to do some serious research before setting out. Figure out what you want to create and hunt out a great jeweller whose style you admire. If you're not sure where to start, book an online consultation with a jeweller you like the look of and investigate their previous projects.

Look online and on Instagram, too.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Once you have an idea of what you want, approach the jeweller – they will guide you through your ideas and complement with some of their own.”<br></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Life Lessons with Lily Collins" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-ll-lilycollins-1-copy-6424342a8e9ec.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmS3psPEpaOeqqlixKLAwqGcrGeRaIV5hZNpa3JnmKTEbsDOZqmeqKWnvbC%2FxGahnq%2BVobmmvtho</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-repurpose-jewellery.html&text=How%20to%20repurpose%20old%20jewellery%20and%20reset%20gemstones&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-repurpose-jewellery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-repurpose-jewellery.html&title=How%20to%20repurpose%20old%20jewellery%20and%20reset%20gemstones" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-to-repurpose-jewellery.html&title=How%20to%20repurpose%20old%20jewellery%20and%20reset%20gemstones" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-repurpose-jewellery.html&title=How%20to%20repurpose%20old%20jewellery%20and%20reset%20gemstones" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-repurpose-jewellery.html&description=How%20to%20repurpose%20old%20jewellery%20and%20reset%20gemstones" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sceptres-orb-meaning-facts-history-king-charles-coronation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What to Know About the Orb and Sceptres Crown Jewels">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./delta-gamma-recruitment-video-see-the-gifs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Delta Gamma Recruitment Video: See the GIFs!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
