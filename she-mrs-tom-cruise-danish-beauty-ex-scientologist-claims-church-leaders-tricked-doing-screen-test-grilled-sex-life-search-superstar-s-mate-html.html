I went to the Org and I had normal looking clothes on, I don't wear so much make up, I don't need to. I don't wear lip stick or mascara. But they had this make up team. They said we had to put on. They had a big box of make up and brushes.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'They didn't want me to look completely natural.

They wanted me to look perfect, the best they can get me. When the Sea Org are given an order, they need to deliver, comply, they were pressured to make me look perfect.

They said we had to put on.<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I thought this is a Scientology training video and I have to put make up, come on. I was shocked. I've seen a lot of crazy things in Scientology, so I thought whatever. So I just went with it, but it was awkward. They were working under pressure to a deadline, they were in a rush, everything had to be perfect, it's just normal in Scientology.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I had to sign a confidentiality agreement when I did something for a Scientology magazine earlier.

I told them about all the Church courses I'd done, I just wanted to show how dedicated I am.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'They weren't very specific at this point.

I didn't know what to expect, then I received a call about a week later from the manager of this project or whatever he called it. I recall his name was Greg Wilhere. I was a little bit scared. I felt he had real authority, it was more like an interrogation, he was very sharp. He said he had some questions for me.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>At the time, Greg Wilhere was Tom Cruise's right hand man. He shadowed him everywhere. Such was his influence, Tom even named a character after him in the movie Days Of Thunder.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But Anette knew none of this. To her, it was still an audition for a training video even thought the interrogation seemed strange.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'He asked if he could ask personal questions. I was with other members, so left the room and went into another and locked the door.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'That's when it started. 'Do you have any history of sexual irregularities?' I said: 'What do you mean?' And in my head, I'm thinking: 'Did he really ask that question?'&nbsp;</span></p>He wanted to make sure I knew what he meant by sexual irregularities, so asked about perversions, homosexuality, threesomes, and I said no.<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'He said any sexual perversions, I said no. He then asked if I had any homosexuality, any sex with the person of the same sex. He wanted to make sure I knew what he meant by sexual irregularities, so asked about perversions, homosexuality, threesomes, and I said no.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'He wanted to make sure my sexual record was clean. I didn't dare ask any questions back because he was very strict.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I was thinking he needed to check it because if I'm going to be part of this training video, then maybe later they find out I'm not clean, they will have to re-film it. I justified it in my head that they needed to do this to make sure that it's all ok.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I knew they could have access to my folders, so I couldn't lie. I didn't feel good about it, I felt it was too personal to ask. He started off with how you doing sort of thing, then I had to give examples of sexual irregularities. I said I didn't have any.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'After that, nothing happened. I didn't hear anything and didn't tell anyone as I was told it was a secret project, so didn't say anything.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'A few years later, I read an interview with Paul Haggis [film director and ex-Scientologist] about Tom Cruise and auditions and I thought: "Oh My God that's exactly the process I went through."</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I kept it a secret for years as I didn't think it was true, that they had really come to Copenhagen to do this. But they had,' she claims.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Only one other woman has ever been exposed for performing in a Tom Cruise girlfriend audition even though the Church has apparently run through hundreds of video tapes, according to former Scientologists, including Marc Headley.</span></p><h3 class=wocc><span class=mol-style-bold>THE 'CASTING COUCH' AUDITIONS TO FIND TOM CRUISE A NEW BRIDE&nbsp;</span></h3><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The Church of Scientology has vehemently denied claims made in the book Going Clear, published in 2013, that Tom Cruise auditioned a host of Hollywood beauties including Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan and Kate Bosworth to be his wife before settling on Katie Holmes.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Allegedly disappointed by his split from Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz in 2004 after she failed to embrace Scientology, Cruise, 53, allowed senior members of the church to summon the unwitting stars to read for a non-existent part in the 'Mission: Impossible' series.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>According to Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison Belief, the Top Gun star initiated the unusual casting couch-style marriage interviews after a complaint to his sister at a Scientology church opening in Madrid that no one had been able to find him a new girlfriend.</span></p><img id=i-de6ff60a9a84f72d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/27/15/2BB59BE300000578-3212910-image-a-13_1440686297193.jpg

Nazanin Boniadi&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The Hollywood mega-star also allegedly made the same complaint to Scientologist leader and his best friend David Miscavige after his three-year relationship with Cruz ended, who according to the book wasted no time in beginning the search for a suitable Mrs. Cruise.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Lawyers for Tom Cruise have vehemently insisted that no such conversations ever occurred while he was in Spain.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>However, the tell-all book, penned by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Lawrence Wright, alleges that Scientologist matchmakers arranged for 'auditions' at the organization's Celebrity Center in Los Angeles and invited the bevy of what were young and promising actresses.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The book claims that each of the girls including hell-raiser Lohan, who was 18 in 2004, Alba, who is now happily married with two children and Johansson, were not chosen and in 2005 Cruise instead met Katie Holmes and then infamously jumped on Oprah Winfrey's couch.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Holmes, who is now 36, split from Cruise in 2012 and took primary custody of their child, Suri.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The book also claims that prior to the auditions of the would-be stars, Cruise was hooked up with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who is now 35 and starred in Homeland.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Vanity Fair magazine's special correspondent Maureen Orth reported that Shelly Miscavige, the wife of David Miscavige was part of the search to find Tom Cruise a suitable girlfriend.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The magazine contended that Boniadi was convinced by Scientology leaders that she had been selected for a project that would help further her religion and would lead to her meeting 'world leaders' and having an influential role in the church.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Allegedly, top Scientology official Greg Wilhere told the actress to darken her hair, remove her orthodontic braces and that she break up with her long term boyfriend, who was also part of the controversial religion and with whom she was reportedly deeply in love.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>When she refused to do that, Wilhere allegedly showed Boniadi evidence that her boyfriend had cheated on her and that led her to break up their relationship.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>This may be because most did not even know they were going through an audition or were ordered to keep quiet because they were still in Scientology.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Iranian model Nazanin Boniadi got through the screen test but was cast aside after a couple of months because she supposedly insulted David Miscavige when she couldn't understand his accent.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>If you pass, like Nazanin, you'll be prepped for your first date or, if you're like Anette and fail, you'll never hear from them

Scientology makes sure you get enough positive outcomes that you continue to put money in the pot until the point on which the negative experiences outweigh the positives.

There was no project, secret or otherwise, ever conducted by the Church to find a bride, via audition or otherwise, for any member. It should also be noted that the discredited individual who originated this ridiculous claim can’t even keep his story straight as he is on record telling four entirely different versions.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKAc32RcmhpZ4Odsm6Z0axkjaedYpCzwcisnGZ8kaO2tLSMm5yaraSueqbEjIyaop2eqbytu8aiqq1lk6GuqrnSZnqhraKYtW64xJqbnqqjYsGztcKknJ1llKS2r7OMrJqrnZWjerWx0q1koKqZobmmsIysnLFlnJ6zpnnSnpirm5hiwLa8xKuqrZmiYsBuucCtnGegpKK5</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshe-mrs-tom-cruise-danish-beauty-ex-scientologist-claims-church-leaders-tricked-doing-screen-test-grilled-sex-life-search-superstar-s-mate-html.html&text=Anette%20Iren%20Johansen%20claims%20Scientology%20auditioned%20her%20as%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20mate&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshe-mrs-tom-cruise-danish-beauty-ex-scientologist-claims-church-leaders-tricked-doing-screen-test-grilled-sex-life-search-superstar-s-mate-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshe-mrs-tom-cruise-danish-beauty-ex-scientologist-claims-church-leaders-tricked-doing-screen-test-grilled-sex-life-search-superstar-s-mate-html.html&title=Anette%20Iren%20Johansen%20claims%20Scientology%20auditioned%20her%20as%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20mate" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshe-mrs-tom-cruise-danish-beauty-ex-scientologist-claims-church-leaders-tricked-doing-screen-test-grilled-sex-life-search-superstar-s-mate-html.html&title=Anette%20Iren%20Johansen%20claims%20Scientology%20auditioned%20her%20as%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20mate" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshe-mrs-tom-cruise-danish-beauty-ex-scientologist-claims-church-leaders-tricked-doing-screen-test-grilled-sex-life-search-superstar-s-mate-html.html&title=Anette%20Iren%20Johansen%20claims%20Scientology%20auditioned%20her%20as%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20mate" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshe-mrs-tom-cruise-danish-beauty-ex-scientologist-claims-church-leaders-tricked-doing-screen-test-grilled-sex-life-search-superstar-s-mate-html.html&description=Anette%20Iren%20Johansen%20claims%20Scientology%20auditioned%20her%20as%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20mate" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-liverpools-mo-salah-got-incredible-abs-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Liverpool's Mo Salah got his incredible abs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kader-khan-movies-1288670.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="7 best Kader Khan movies that define Bollywoods golden era">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
