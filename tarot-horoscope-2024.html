In numerology, each year is bestowed with something called <a href=#>a Universal Year </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>number</a> that signifies what you can look forward to in the new year. This single digit number is the summation of each number within the year, and in the case of 2024, that number is 8, because 2+0+2+4 adds up to 8. In numerology, the number 8 holds much promise, as it is symbolically tied to manifestation, financial expansion, strength, and transformation. You spent a lot of time clearing away blockages and removing yourself from what is no longer meant for you during 2023, as 2+0+2+3 adds up to a 7. In numerology, the Universal Year number of 7 reflects spirituality, reflection, and inner work, which is one reason why 2023 was so damn difficult. Luckily, it paved the way for the blessings that will arrive during 2024.</p><p>If you’re looking for further clarity for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>how 2024 will affect you</a>, the Tarot can provide that and so much more. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>deck of Tarot consists of 78 cards</a>, each one brimming with infinite possibilities. The imagery and the symbolism associated with the Major and Minor Arcana bring your attention to something important that you may not be aware of. And because Sasha Purdy—StyleCaster’s resident graphic designer—is currently working on our very own Tarot card deck, there’s no better time to give you a taste of what these cards have in store for you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=your-2024-tarot-card-reading-for-each-zodiac-sign>Your 2024 Tarot Card Reading For Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Here’s what the main theme of your 2024 experience is looking like, according to a Tarot card pull for your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a>:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8757763975155><h2>Aries: The Emperor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/theemperor.png><p>You’re stepping into a leadership position, but not just one of power and authority. The Emperor indicates that you’re becoming a provider and a caretaker; someone that people in your social circle and community look up to for guidance. And although this new role will require you to become more demanding and strict, it will also ask you to lead with kindness, harmony, and fairness. You’re assuming this role as a leader without putting people down, but uplifting those who reach out to you for advice and instruction. <a href=#>Read your full 2024 yearly horoscope </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.1619190404798><h2>Taurus: 9 of Cups</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/nineofcups.png><p>2024 is marked my prosperity and abundance, but especially for you. After all, the 9 of Cups signifies happiness, emotional fulfillment, and contentment. Some consider it the “wish card”, which means that 2024 could very well be the year that all your wildest hopes and dreams come true. During 2024, you will have everything you need in terms of love, work, relationships, lifestyle, health, and wealth. And if you’re still having doubts, let the 9 of Cups be proof that all your efforts are paying off and the Universe is returning the favor. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full 2024 yearly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3638268156425><h2>Gemini: Queen of Cups</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/queenofcups.png><p>In 2024, you are literally Mother. That’s right—the Queen of Cups signifies that you’re stepping into your role as a lover, a nurturer, and an intuitive healer, but only in the most esteemed sense. This year, you’re becoming someone that others lean on for support in its most tender and heartfelt form. If you’ve always been avoidant or resistant to forming emotional ties, 2024 will be the year your heart strengthens its roots and sustains those around you in a mutually beneficial exchange. The Queen of Cups wants to be there for others because it teaches her how to be there for herself. <a href=#>Read your full yearly 2024 </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>horoscope</a><a href=#> here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4100877192982><h2>Cancer: The Tower</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/thetower.png><p>2024 has the power to be rather unpredictable, but not necessarily in a negative way. The Tower signifies sudden changes that completely transform your reality, forcing you to rebuild from the rubble. These changes can manifest in the physical, but they can also unfold in a more spiritual sense as revelations and epiphanies create massive upheaval in your life. All you need to know is that not everything is in your control this year, which is perfectly OK.

This year demands a lot of discipline and hard work, but it’s well worth your while. The Knight of Pentacles signifies that you have a goal in mind and you’ll stop at nothing in order to achieve it. During 2024, you should establish a healthy and efficient routine and stay focused on the task at hand.

Instead of lying to get your way or putting your faith in get-rich-quick schemes, you should roll up your sleeves and do the hard work yourself whenever you can. The 7 of Swords is warning you against trying to take the easy way out instead of doing something in a way that is tried and true. It is also warning you against people who seem to have your best interests at heart, but are actually keeping secrets from you.
