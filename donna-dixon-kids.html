After completing her education at Groveton High School, she joined George Washington University.</p><p>However, she could not balance her studies while also pursuing a modeling and acting career. Today, we’ll talk about Dixon’s kids, net worth, and what she is doing now.</p><h2>Who is Donna Dixon?</h2><p>Donna Dixon is a television personality and retired pageant contestant with two titles to her name. She was born on July 20th, 1957 to Earl Roy and Mary Ruth Dixon in Alexandria, Virginia. Furthermore, her parents raised her alongside two other siblings, her brother Earl and sister Sherrie.</p><p>Donna was crowned as Miss Virginia in 1976 and then Miss Washington DC the following year. Soon after, Dixon launched her modeling career by signing on with the prestigious Wilhelmina Modeling Agency.</p><p>Donna got her first acting break in 1980 by appearing in Bosom Buddies. Later in 1983, she featured in the Hollywood blockbuster,&nbsp; Doctor Detroit. It gave her the opportunity to work alongside Don Aykroyd, who she married the very same year.</p><p>Moreover, she later starred in several hit movies like ‘Twilight Zone: the movie’ ‘Spies like us,’ ‘The couch trip,’ ‘Lucky Stiff,’ ‘The Nanny,’ ‘Nixon,’ etc. Donna remained active in the film industry right up until 1997.</p><p>However, she resurfaced in ‘The Twilight Zone as Meghan #2’s voice.</p><h2>What is Donna Dixon doing now?</h2><p>Donna retired from the film industry after a long successful career as an actress. Even though she no longer works on set, Dixon now works as a voice-over actress. Moreover, Donna Dixon even took up producing alongside her husband, Dan Aykroyd.</p><p>In addition, the couple runs various business and non-profit foundations. They started the Blue Line Foundation to redevelop flood-damaged areas in New Orleans. Lastly, Donna also owns a fashion company ‘Paradise Bag Company.’</p><h2>Donna Dixon’s Husband</h2><p>Dixon met her husband, Dan Aykryod, in 1983 while working on the set of ‘Doctor Detroit.’ They saw each other for some time, before tying the knot in 1983.</p><p>Donna and her husband enjoyed a professional relationship as well, appearing in multiple films before they took a step back from the industry. Her husband, Dan Arkryod, is a Canadian national who found prominence in Hollywood as a comedic actor.</p><p>One striking similarity between the two is that they are both college dropouts. Dan, an Emmy award-winning actor, has starred in over 75 movies, 25 TV shows, and voiced characters in over 106 films.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-3523 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Donna-D-xon-husband-Dan-Aykryod.jpg alt="Donna Dixon with her husband, Dan Aykryod" width=594 height=493 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-3523 class=wp-caption-text>Television personality, Donna Dixon with her husband, Dan Aykroyd</p><h2>Donna’s Children</h2><p>Donna has now been married for 38 long years and shares three beautiful daughters with her husband.
