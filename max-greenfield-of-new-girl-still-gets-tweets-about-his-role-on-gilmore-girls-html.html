He appeared in The O.C. for one episode in 2007. In 2008 he was a recurring character in Freeform’s Greek, a series that followed the lives of college students involved in the Greek system. The same year he took on the role of Nick Pepper in Ugly Betty. Later, he would join the cast of <a href=#>New Girl</a>, the show that ensured Greenfield was easily recognizable. Before all of that, though, Greenfield showed up in Gilmore Girls, and fans are not about to let him forget it.</p><h2>Greenfield appeared on Gilmore Girls long before New Girl</h2><p id=par-2_72>New Girl premiered in 2011, and Schmidt became an instant fan favorite. Sure, he was supposed to be a “douche,” but it was clear from the word go that <a href=#>Schmidt</a> was way more complicated than that. Over seven seasons, fans watched Schmidt develop and change. They watched him find the woman of his dreams and settle down. Greenfield’s portrayal was inspired, but a lot of people still remember him from a bit part on Gilmore Girls.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1 readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/ZmK2ERC9gPs</p></figure><p id=par-3_81>Back in 2003, Greenfield took a minor role in Gilmore Girls. He appeared in exactly one episode for no more than 120 seconds, yet his portrayal of a drunken college kid remains memorable. In the episode “Chicken or Beef,” Greenfield portrays a friend of <a href=#>Dean Forrester</a>. Dean, set to marry Lindsay the very next day, stumbles into Luke’s Diner, drunk with his friends. Greenfield’s only line in the show was about how his name was Luke too, and that he and <a href=#>Luke Danes</a> should start a club.</p><h2>Greenfield still gets tweets about playing the other Luke</h2><p id=par-4_34>Greenfield may not have considered the part consequential at the time, but Gilmore Girls fans rarely forget anything. Greenfield appeared on <a href=#>People’s Couch Surfing</a> and discussed his Gilmore Girls role. Apparently, people are still tweeting about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Max-Greenfield.jpg><p id=par-5_83>When pressed about how he prepared for the drunken role, he insists he wasn’t method acting. Greenfield simply stated that he just went for it, and acted drunk for the entirety of the scene. He did pull it off pretty well, and it was probably good practice. Once Greenfield took on the role of Schmidt on New Girl he had to act drunk more than a few times. After all, the loft mates never turned down a chance to play <a href=#>True American</a>.</p><h2>Will Gilmore Girls return for a second revival?</h2><p id=par-6_75>While Greenfield likely won’t be reprising a role in <a href=#>Stars Hollow</a> anytime soon, it’s possible the series regulars could be back for at least one more revival season. Back in 2016, Amy Sherman-Palladino, the mastermind behind Gilmore Girls, was completely noncommittal about coming back for a second season. She told <a href=#>Vogue</a> that the season told the story that the cast and crew wanted to tell. Anyone who has watched the Netflix original, however, knows that Sherman-Palladino left fans with a massive cliffhanger.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_101>Now, four years later, it looks like the series is getting a lot closer to a second revival season. Sherman-Palladino has allegedly been in talks with Netflix about developing a second reboot. It is unknown when the series would air, and what storyline it would follow. While Greenfield won’t be reprising his minimal role in the series, fans can assume they’d get to catch up with Luke, Lorelai, Rory, and <a href=#>Emily Gilmore</a>. Hopefully, Melissa McCarthy will join the cast to reprise her role as <a href=#>Sookie St. James</a> in a larger capacity this time around; that is if it actually happens.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6osSMoKmenZ6btqa4w2amn2WemsRus8iro2arpJ65rXnGnqusZaSssqbA0maYm6elqXqptdJmqaiklWK8r3nGoqOmp6Kaeqi10aWqZ6Ckorlw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmax-greenfield-of-new-girl-still-gets-tweets-about-his-role-on-gilmore-girls-html.html&text=Max%20Greenfield%20of%20%27New%20Girl%27%20Still%20Gets%20Tweets%20About%20His%20Role%20on%20%27Gilmore%20Girls%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmax-greenfield-of-new-girl-still-gets-tweets-about-his-role-on-gilmore-girls-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmax-greenfield-of-new-girl-still-gets-tweets-about-his-role-on-gilmore-girls-html.html&title=Max%20Greenfield%20of%20%27New%20Girl%27%20Still%20Gets%20Tweets%20About%20His%20Role%20on%20%27Gilmore%20Girls%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmax-greenfield-of-new-girl-still-gets-tweets-about-his-role-on-gilmore-girls-html.html&title=Max%20Greenfield%20of%20%27New%20Girl%27%20Still%20Gets%20Tweets%20About%20His%20Role%20on%20%27Gilmore%20Girls%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmax-greenfield-of-new-girl-still-gets-tweets-about-his-role-on-gilmore-girls-html.html&title=Max%20Greenfield%20of%20%27New%20Girl%27%20Still%20Gets%20Tweets%20About%20His%20Role%20on%20%27Gilmore%20Girls%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmax-greenfield-of-new-girl-still-gets-tweets-about-his-role-on-gilmore-girls-html.html&description=Max%20Greenfield%20of%20%27New%20Girl%27%20Still%20Gets%20Tweets%20About%20His%20Role%20on%20%27Gilmore%20Girls%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./princess-stephanie-of-monaco.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Princess Stephanie - Net Worth, Height, Career, Divorcee, Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lauren-graham-hilariously-reveals-downside-of-being-neighbors-with-dax-shepard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lauren Graham Reveals Downside Of Being Neighbors With Dax Shepard">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
