There are many successful women who have been killing it socially, economically, and politically, and today we celebrate all of them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With the amazing growth in influencer marketing, a lot of female influencers have stepped into the entrepreneurship game and founded their own brands. The majority of them have become very successful because no other brands know their audience as well as they do. They know what their followers would expect, and what they would want to see. This, in return, helped them to become household names in the business.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, without further ado, let’s dive into our list of powerful female influencers who are taking the business world by storm!</span></p><h2><b>Aimee Song</b></h2><p><span>The mega-influencer Aimee Song is the founder of Songs of Style – a blog, YouTube series, lifestyle brand, and clothing line. When Aimee reflects on her path, she isn’t afraid to admit that everything we see and experience today started as a simple project of passion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While studying Interior Architecture in San Francisco, Song began blogging in 2008. She started her blog as a place to promote her interior design aesthetic and portfolio shoots, but when her posts about what she was wearing drew a lot of interest, and thus she decided to turn it into a personal style blog. And three years ago, she launched her clothing line Songs of Style in collaboration with e-commerce site Revolve.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Aimee’s personal Instagram account has now over 6M+ followers, and her brand’s account @songsofstyle has 300K+.</span></p><h2><b>Chiara Ferragni</b></h2><p><span>Chiara Ferragni, without a doubt, has become one of the icons in the influencer world. She launched her fashion blog, The Blonde Salad, back in 2009 when she was still studying international law at Bocconi University in Milan. Ferragni has since transformed the blog into a worldwide retail enterprise and amassed a 26 million-strong Instagram following.</span></p><p><span>Ferragni’s namesake line, Chiara Ferragni Collection, started out in 2013 as a footwear line with Luisa Via Roma. It has since expanded into clothing, accessories, and children’s wear and boasts four flagship stores and over 300 retail doors. Chiara’s success case has been studied at Harvard University, which gives us the clue that she’s the real deal.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Emily Weiss</b></h2><p><span>The launch of the millennial cult-beauty company Glossier was perfectly timed for the ultimate influencer Emily Weiss. After starting her career as an intern at Teen Vogue, she went on to found the popular beauty site Into the Gloss, which includes the renowned #TopShelf. Emily’</span><span>s rich insight was only right for her to take to the drawing board to seek finance for her own beauty line, developed just for us: daily skincare, cosmetics, and more.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Weiss’ early interactions with other beauty enthusiasts demonstrated where traditional beauty businesses had failed her and her fans. With the debut of Glossier’s first collection of four products in 2014, comprising a cleanser, priming moisturizer, lip balm, and misting spray, she produced solutions. After that, the rest is history.</span></p><h2><b>Arielle Charnas</b></h2><p><span>​​Arielle Charnas’ desire of having her own business was always a dream, and as a style connoisseur and exquisite, she achieved it. Arielle’s first self-made drop: Something Navy shop, created and curated intentionally for the Something Navy girl, began as an Instagram handle in 2009 to share outfit inspo with a community of fellow style enthusiasts. This led to Arielle fabricating a clothing line collaboration with partner Nordstrom and eventually in 2020, she launched Something Navy.</span></p><p><span>@ariellecharnas has 1.3M+ followers on Instagram and her brand @somethingnavy has 300K+.</span></p><h2><b>Huda Kattan</b></h2><p><span>We didn’t want to finish this list without dropping her name, because that wouldn’t be fair.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s not every day that a simple blog can turn into a multimillion-dollar beauty empire – unless you’re Huda Kattan, the creator, and CEO of HudaBeauty. Huda controls the keys in the inclusive beauty product sector, relying on her 50 million Instagram followers (yes, 50 million) for insight, inspiration, and to remind her why she started this company in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She started her business with false eyelashes by borrowing 6K USD from her sisters. She didn’t know if she was going to be successful, but she tried anyway. Her lashes were praised by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, and the collection was bought up by Sephora Dubai in 2013. The world met with the HudaBeauty sensation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s no easy accomplishment to take your effect on a community to the next level in an authentic, enjoyable, and inclusive way. From working for their favorite brands to becoming the founders of their own brands, influencers’ journey is ever-changing. These ladies got it right!</span></p><p><strong>Happy International Women’s Day to all the beautiful women out there!
