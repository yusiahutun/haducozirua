Although he currently plays in free safety, Patriot captain Devin McCourty is equally good at cornerback and kickoff return.</p><p>He is one of America’s best football players, who has made the country’s football league more interesting through his technical skills and perfect tactical abilities.</p><h2><strong>Devin McCourty Bio, Career</strong></h2><p>Devin McCourty was born in Nyack, New York on August 13, 1987, and grew up with his twin brother Jason McCourty at his mother Phyllis Harrell’s side, while her father Calvin McCourty died at the age of three.</p><p>With the help and support of their hard-working mother, Devin and his brother went to St. Joseph’s High School in Montvale, which happens to be one of the best all-boy schools in New Jersey. There Devin became interested in the school and developed his skills as an athlete. In high school, he played cornerback and free safety and was an all-league team in his last two seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Devin-McCourty.jpg><p>He also played basketball as a point guard. As a result, he was included in the All-League squad and was one of the few Rivals.com rated as a two-star recruit.</p><p>As a high school student, he scored 50 tackles, three interceptions and three blocked kicks in special teams. This made him the first-team All-Big East in Rutgers in 2009 before he was voted 27th overall in the 2010 NFL Draft.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Fletcher Cox Wife, Salary, Net Worth, Dating, Girlfriend, Family, Facts</a></strong></p><p>During his first year of college, Devin retired and played in 13 games, scoring a total of 38 tackles and two interceptions. He also scored 25.4 yards on kickoff returns and had a 98-yard kickoff return, the third-longest in school history. With a career-high of 80 tackles and 10 pass shots, he was appointed to the first team of All-Big East.</p><p>Devin McCourty began his professional NFL career in 2010 with the New England Patriots after signing a five-year contract with the team on July 28, 2010. The 2010 NFL Draft saw another great achievement for him as he was voted 27th overall in the first round by the New England Patriots. He was celebrated as the first Team All-Pro by Sporting News and the second Team All-Pro by The Associated Press.</p><p>In 2015 McCourty won the Super Bowl XLIX with the Patriots against the Seattle Seahawks (28-24). This was after he made an interception on the Ravens’ quarterback, Joe Flacco, in the AFC Divisional Playoffs game against the Baltimore Ravens. As proof of his tactical skills on the football field, McCourty was named co-captain for the fifth consecutive year. In December 2017 he was named Pro Bowl 2017 and received this honor for the second time.</p><h2><strong>Income and Net Worth&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Today, the NFL star is not only famous for his skills, but also for the wealth he has accumulated as a footballer. His net worth is $28 million with an annual income of over $10 million.</p><p>Like other celebrities, Devin has a fleet of luxury cars worth over $2 million and a house worth $3 million.</p><p>McCourty’s renewed 5-year contract is valued at $47.5 million, including a $15 million contract bonus and a $7 million guaranteed compensation. During his time with the Patriots, McCourty played 107 games and completed 19 interceptions and 418 tackles.</p><h2><strong>Devin McCourty Brother</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Devin-McCourty-Career.jpg><p>Devin McCourty has a twin brother, Jason McCourty, who is currently playing as a cornerback for the Tennessee Titans. Interesting about the McCourty twins is that they were born 27 minutes apart, with Devin being the older brother. The twins also began their football career at St. Joseph’s High School in Montvale, where they started as a cornerback in 2007.</p><p>Jason is also an NFL star, although he will have much success in his career as his brother. While Jason has never been to the playoffs, Devin is about to play his second Super Bowl. Nevertheless, the two brothers have remained close friends, helping and supporting each other in their careers.</p><p>The McCourty twins are one of the 12 pairs of identical twins in NFL history. They are also one of the three active pairs of twins in the NFL. Others are Mike and Maurkice Pouncey; Brandon and Brian Dixon. There are only a few ways to distinguish between Devin and his brother Jason. The first is their birthmark. While Jason has a birthmark on his neck and wrist, his older brother Devin has only one birthmark on his ear. Again Devin has a chickenpox scar on his nose, while Jason has a scar on his forehead.</p><p>In May 2017, Jason signed a two-year, $6 million contract with the Cleveland Browns. Both Devin and Jason are well-known philanthropists. They have both dedicated their time and wealth to sickle cell research, as several members of their family are affected by the disease, including their father.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Patrick Chung?

He married Powell in April 2016 at the Venetian in New Jersey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Devin-McCourty-Brother.jpe><p>Michelle Zapata Powell was born on March 18, 1988, in Syosset, New Jersey. She is one of the children of Jerome Powell and Carolita Powell (née Zapata). The couple met at Rutgers University and became engaged in 2015 after Devin asked the question at Disney World.</p><p>In March 2016, the lovebirds welcomed their first child, a girl they called Londyn Brielle McCourty. His brother Jason is also married. He married Melissa McCourty and both have three children.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts About Devin McCourty</strong></h2><table width=289><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td><strong>Full Name:</strong></td><td>Devin McCourty</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date:</strong></td><td>August 13,&nbsp;1987</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope:</strong></td><td>Leo</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place:</strong></td><td>New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height:</strong></td><td>1.78&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Tackles:</strong></td><td>632</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Current Team:</strong></td><td>New England Patriots&nbsp;(#32 / Defensive back)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity:</strong></td><td>African-American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;marital status</strong></td><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Married</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse:</strong></td><td>Michelle Powell</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Number of Children:</strong></td><td>One (Londyn Brielle McCourty )</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality:</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>&nbsp;<strong>Siblings:</strong></td><td>&nbsp;Jason McCourty,&nbsp;Larry McCourty</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksabCyKdkppuTpMKzwNhmmaKnXZe%2FsMDHnqlmr5mbsm6zyKujn6qZmrulec2eq2avn6fBqXnFmpqtq18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdevin-mccourty-bio-brother-wife-girlfriend-net-worth-facts.html&text=Devin%20McCourty%20Bio%2c%20Brother%2c%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdevin-mccourty-bio-brother-wife-girlfriend-net-worth-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdevin-mccourty-bio-brother-wife-girlfriend-net-worth-facts.html&title=Devin%20McCourty%20Bio%2c%20Brother%2c%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdevin-mccourty-bio-brother-wife-girlfriend-net-worth-facts.html&title=Devin%20McCourty%20Bio%2c%20Brother%2c%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdevin-mccourty-bio-brother-wife-girlfriend-net-worth-facts.html&title=Devin%20McCourty%20Bio%2c%20Brother%2c%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdevin-mccourty-bio-brother-wife-girlfriend-net-worth-facts.html&description=Devin%20McCourty%20Bio%2c%20Brother%2c%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erin-barry-is-tony-parker-mistress-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erin Barry is Tony Parker Mistress (PHOTOS)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./appointments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Appointments | South China Morning Post">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
