He is regarded as a role model by many aspiring and established cinema producers, directors, and screenwriters.</h3><p>So, how well-versed in Robert Zemeckis are you? If not much, we’ve assembled everything you need to know about Robert Zemeckis’s net worth in 2021, including his age, height, weight, wife, children, biography, and personal information. Thus, if you’re ready, here’s all we know about Robert Zemeckis so far.</p><h2>Net Worth, Salary, and Earnings of Robert Zemeckis</h2><p>Robert has not only gained renown and received numerous honors and nominations as a result of his efforts, but he has also amassed a substantial sum of money. His net worth is expected to reach <strong>$80 million</strong> in 2021. We wish him the best of luck and anticipate that he will soon surpass the <strong>$100 million</strong> mark.</p><h2>Early Life and Biography</h2><p>Robert Lee Zemeckis was born on the 14th of May in 1952 in Illinois, Chicago, United States of America, under the name Robert Lee Zemeckis. Because his father, Alphonse Zemeckis, was a Lithuanian-American, Robert is of Lithuanian-American ethnicity. His mother, Rosa (née Nespeca), on the other hand, was Italian-American. He was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised on the outskirts of the city. He never considered becoming a filmmaker as a child because there was no place in their house for it.</p><h2>Age, Height, Weight, and Body Dimensions</h2><p>So, how old is Robert Zemeckis in 2021, and how tall and how heavy is he? Robert Zemeckis, who was born on May 14, 1952, is 69 years old as of today’s date, August 7, 2021. Despite his height of 6′ 00′′ in feet and inches and 183 cm in centimetres, he weighs 176.37 pounds and 80 kilograms.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>Robert is not only wealthy, but also well-educated. His early years of education were spent at a Roman Catholic elementary school. He enrolled at Fenger Academy High School after graduating from elementary school. Robert has always enjoyed television and has a desire to work in the film industry since he was a child. Fortunately, he discovered the existence of film schools and promptly informed his parents of his intention to enroll. Unfortunately, this task was hard to complete because the parents were completely opposed to the notion. Finally, he was able to persuade them, and he was accepted into Northern Illinois University in Dekalb, Illinois. He eventually transferred from Northern Illinois University to the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Dating, girlfriends, wife, and kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Zemeckis-with-wife-Leslie-Harter.jpg><p>Despite the fact that Robert admits to spending much of his time buried in his career, he was fortunate enough to marry a woman. His marriage to actress Marry Ellen Trainor, on the other hand, did not go so well, though they were able to keep it going for a while. They married in the 1980s and had a kid together, but after discovering their marriage wasn’t working well, they divorced. Robert, on the other hand, never lost up on love and married his second wife, actress Leslie Harter, on December 4, 2001. They have three children together. Zane Zemeckis, Alexander Zemeckis, Rhys Zemeckis, and Zsa Zsa Rose Zemeckis are his children’s names.</p><h2>A Professional Life</h2>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Robert Zemeckis (@utccdf043)</a></p><p>At a young age, Robert was enthralled by television. Because his parents had a home video camera, he decided to put what he had learned on television into practice by shooting family events. He honed his skills over time by enlisting the help of his pals in the production of narrative films. This, however, was insufficient, and he decided to continue his education at Northern University of Illinois.</p><p>After a series of missteps, he was able to reclaim his fans’ attention in the 1980s after directing Romancing the Stone, which was released in 1984. Back to the Future, a science-fiction comedy, was released in 1985, followed by Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a 1988 comedy. His success in producing Death Becomes Her propelled him into dramatic roles. Forrest Gump, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Director in the category of Best Director, is another dramatic film he worked on. Robert has directed films in a variety of genres, including family and adult films.</p><h2>Awards</h2><p>Robert has received numerous awards and nominations over his career in the film industry, including the Academy Award for Best Director.
