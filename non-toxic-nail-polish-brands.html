But the varnish that makes your tips and toes pop is actually made up of chemical ingredients and solvents that can irritate skin, cause allergic reactions, and even lead to headaches, hormone disruptions, and certain types of cancer. That’s why finding a non-toxic nail polish you love is vital to your health.</p>Read More<p>It’s scary but true: Multiple studies have shown that even polish labeled “non-toxic” can contain <a rel=noopener href=#>endocrine-disrupting plasticizers</a>, and one <a rel=noopener href=#>2015 study</a> by researchers at Duke University found evidence of triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) — a chemical that interferes with normal hormone functioning and is found in furniture fire retardant — in the bodies of every person who painted their nails for the study. Eek!</p><p>If this all sounds frightening, fear not. You don’t need to swear off manicures and pedicures forever. There are plenty of non-toxic nail polish brands that are free of most of these commonly found toxic chemicals, so you can protect your nails — as well as your overall health — during your next <a href=#>DIY or salon polish session</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How do you know if a nail polish is truly non-toxic?</strong></h2><p>As research has evolved over the past decade, it’s no surprise that many savvy beauty lovers are looking for non-toxic nail polishes to minimize exposure to harsh or potentially harmful toxins.&nbsp;</p><p>At a minimum, you’ll want to make sure your polish of choice is labeled “5-free,” which refers to polishes that are not made of the following five ingredients: formaldehyde (a carcinogen and skin irritant that makes polish shine and chip resistant), toluene (a potentially neurotoxic nail polish solvent), dibutyl phthalate (a plasticizer), formaldehyde resin, and camphor (an ingredient that gives polishes their shine but has been linked to skin irritation, allergies, nausea, dizziness, and headaches).</p><p>These days, the gold standard for clean nail polish are 10-free, 14-free, and even 16-free, which means they contain no formaldehyde, toluene, DBP, formaldehyde resin, camphor, ethyl tosylamide, xylene, parabens, acetone, TPHP, TBHP, and they’re also free of gluten, vegan-friendly, and cruelty-free. We dug a bit deeper and found the best non-toxic polish brands out there — all of which are at least 8-free. <strong>Keep reading to shop Woman’s World’s picks</strong> <strong>for healthy, non-toxic nail polish brands you’ll love.</strong></p><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Sally Hansen Good.
