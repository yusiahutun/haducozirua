The producers of reality TV series have to balance between genuine and authentic interaction. A reality TV show like <i>Alone</i> is themed on tragedy, where the contestants are separated from society and placed into the jungle to survive. Due to the dangers met in the wilderness, many people have been concerned about the well-being of the contestants. So, has anyone died on Alone?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/17dd9e075d8a4470.jpg><p class=align-left><i>Alone </i>is a reality TV show that follows the self-documented daily struggles of 10 contestants as they strive to survive in the wilderness on very limited resources. Interestingly, none of the contestants knows how well anyone else is doing. They have to keep going until everyone else drops out. The last one not to give up get a cash prize of $500,000.</p><h2>About Alone</h2><p class=align-left><i>Alone </i>is an American survival competition <a href=#>TV series</a> that premiered on 18 June 2015. Participants are dropped off in a remote wilderness area, far enough apart to ensure that they will not come in contact with one another. While documenting their experiences, each contestant must survive in total isolation, hoping to outlast everyone else to claim the $500,000 prize.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b3eddc4416c9bc68.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best My 600 LB Life episodes: Where are the patients now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They are allowed to select ten survival gear items from a list of 40. Additionally, they are issued a kit of standard equipment, clothing and first aid supplies. Apart from that, they are also given a set of cameras to document their daily experiences and emotions. Alongside the cameras, the contestants carry <a href=#>GPS trackers </a>to help production trace them.</p><p class=align-left>As the name implies, every contestant is essentially alone. The participants in this show record the footage independently, after which they submit the cameras for production. The production team then walks into the wilderness and swaps out batteries and media cards to allow more recording.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike other reality shows, the contestants of <i>Alone</i> go through a thorough evaluation of physical and mental health to determine their skills in a given context. However, the show's complexity has always been a concern to producers as they fear letting anyone die accidentally on the show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc0a1406afaa296a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Soaring inflation dampens Eid holiday spirit in crisis-hit Pakistan</span></p></a><h2>Has anyone ever been seriously injured on Alone?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b3eddc4416c9bc68.jpeg><p class=align-left>Medical professionals conduct periodic health checks on the participants to ensure they are always in a suitable condition. Even though an animal has never killed any contestant, Zachary Gault from <i>Alone</i> season 3 accidentally<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> severed a tendon</a> in his hand while wielding an axe. The cut was too deep that he had to leave the contest in eight days.</p><p class=align-left>The other serious injury that happened was in season 4 with Shannon Bosdell. While strolling, Shannon tripped over a log and collapsed. He suffered a spinal injury. As a result, Shannon was removed from the competition for medical reasons.</p><h2>Has anyone been attacked on the show Alone?</h2><p class=align-left>The <i>Alone</i> involves humans leaving their normal habitat and choosing to survive in the wilderness. Meeting dangerous animals such as snakes, jaguars, lions, and bears is inevitable in the wilderness. However, there is no record of anyone being attacked by a <a href=#>wild animal</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fcbc85ed882eaf1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man Causes Traffic Chaos by Throwing Wads of Cash on Busy Highway</span></p></a><h2>What's the longest someone lasted on Alone?</h2><p class=align-left>The reality show is based on how long someone can survive in the jungle. To live in the wilderness for long, contestants must find food, build shelters and endure physical deprivation. They must also have the right tools to face the jungle.</p><p class=align-left>While some people could not go as far as ten days, others made it to more than three months. The longest time someone has lasted in the show is 100 days. Roland Walker, a 47-year-old hunting guide, spend over three months on the <i>Alone </i>show. He joined <i>Alone</i> Season 7, intending to take on this task and add yet another feather to his hat of many.</p><p class=align-left>His skills as a hunting guide came in handy during this challenge.

He used his belt knife, his last remaining weapon, to stab it to death.</p><h2>Is any of Alone staged?</h2><p class=align-left>Everything that happens before and during the filming of <i>Alone </i>is real. The show is known for survivors that show a remarkable level of perseverance and strength, and all these things are challenging to be staged.</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, the physical, psychological and emotional stress the contestants go through is real.
