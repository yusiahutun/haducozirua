The <a href=#>celebrity</a> hitmaker questioned parents who supported their children identifying as a different gender than the sex they were assigned at birth.</p><p>The 43-year-old said that he comes from “an era” where a “man was a man and a woman was a woman.”</p><p>“There were two genders and that’s just how I rocked,” he said. “You could identify as a goldfish if you feel like, that ain’t my business. It becomes my business when you try to make me play the game.</p><p>“I’m not gonna call you a goldfish,” he concluded.</p><p>Speaking on the parents role, he said: “I feel like parents have almost forgotten what the role of a parent is. If your little boy comes to you and says, ‘Daddy, I want to be a girl’ and you just let him rock with that?</p><p>“He’s 5. He can’t drive a car yet, but he can decide his sex?”</p><p>Taking to his <a href=#>Twitter</a> account, Ne-Yo expressed his deepest apologies on the matter.</p><p>In a picture post, the star <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote</a>: “After much reflection, I’d like to express my deepest apologies to anyone that I may have hurt with my comments on parenting and gender identity. I’ve always been an advocate for love and inclusivity in the LGBTQI+ community, so I understand how my comments could’ve been interpreted as insensitive and offensive.”</p><p>“Gender identity is nuanced and I can honestly admit that I plan to better educate myself on the topic, so I can approach future conversations with more empathy. At the end of the day, I lead with love and support everyone’s freedom of expression and pursuit of happiness,” he continued.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Grammy Award winner says he ‘condemns no one’</h2><p>As well as his apology to his millions of followers on Twitter, Ne-Yo has also posted an <a href=#>Instagram</a> story, shutting down claims that he ‘condemns’ parents allowing their children to transition.</p><p>Commenting on a post claiming this, posted on his story, he wrote: “1st and foremost, I CONDEMN NO ONE. Who am I to condemn anybody? Your life, your kids, your choice. I was asked a question and I answered it. My opinion is mine.</p><p>“I’m not asking anybody to agree with me, nor am I telling you what you can and cannot do with your children. I stated my opinion on a matter and that’s that.</p><p>“Why should I care if my opinion upsets you when you don’t care if yours upsets anyone? Opinions aren’t special. We all have one. People voice them regularly, whether they’re asked or not. I was actually asked mine. Agreeing to disagree is not a declaration of war.”</p><p>“Y’all do whatever the hell y’all want to. But my feelings on the matter are mine. Same way yours are yours. Meanwhile, I love everybody. Don’t agree with some of y’all’s ideals….but love you no less,” he continued.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2WEcLrEZrCoZZmowLax0mabnp2gmsC1ecCppqWnl656tbuMrZ%2Boq5VitaZ5x66prWWnnsGpecinqp6mo57BqsLEZpqopZ2au7W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fne-yo-issues-deepest-apology-to-those-he-hurt-with-insensitive-comments.html&text=Ne-Yo%20issues%20%27deepest%20apology%27%20to%20those%20he%20hurt%20with%20%27insensitive%20comments%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fne-yo-issues-deepest-apology-to-those-he-hurt-with-insensitive-comments.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fne-yo-issues-deepest-apology-to-those-he-hurt-with-insensitive-comments.html&title=Ne-Yo%20issues%20%27deepest%20apology%27%20to%20those%20he%20hurt%20with%20%27insensitive%20comments%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fne-yo-issues-deepest-apology-to-those-he-hurt-with-insensitive-comments.html&title=Ne-Yo%20issues%20%27deepest%20apology%27%20to%20those%20he%20hurt%20with%20%27insensitive%20comments%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fne-yo-issues-deepest-apology-to-those-he-hurt-with-insensitive-comments.html&title=Ne-Yo%20issues%20%27deepest%20apology%27%20to%20those%20he%20hurt%20with%20%27insensitive%20comments%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fne-yo-issues-deepest-apology-to-those-he-hurt-with-insensitive-comments.html&description=Ne-Yo%20issues%20%27deepest%20apology%27%20to%20those%20he%20hurt%20with%20%27insensitive%20comments%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jessica-simpson-engagement-ring-eric-johnson-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Simpson Steps Out with Fiance">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-remove-learned-words-from-gboard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Error>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
