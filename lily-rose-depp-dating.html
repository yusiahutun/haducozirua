It’s why she’s chosen to stay so protective of her romantic interests. “My parents protected my brother [Jack] and me from it as much as possible,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Elle</a> in an interview published in November 2022. “I know my childhood didn’t look like everybody’s childhood, and it’s a very particular thing to deal with, but it’s also the only thing that I know.” She continued, in reference to her not commenting on her father’s time in court: “When it’s something that’s so private and so personal that all of a sudden becomes not so personal. … I feel really entitled to my secret garden of thoughts. I also think that I’m not here to answer for anybody, and I feel like for a lot of my career, people have really wanted to define me by the men in my life, whether that’s my family members or my boyfriends, whatever. And I’m really ready to be defined for the things that I put out there.”</p><p>It’s similar to what she said on&nbsp;The Drew Barrymore Show&nbsp;back in 2021. “The value of privacy is something that’s been instilled in me from an early age,” she revealed. “Growing up in a family like I did, it was always something that was—I always learned the importance of privacy and valuing that and keeping things just for yourself. And that’s something that I’ve carried on into my own career and that’s really important to me.” So who is Lily-Rose Depp dating? Here’s what we know.</p><p>Here is a timeline of her relationships.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.8655462184874><h2>070 Shake (February 2023 to present)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1470328991.jpg><p>Like so many celebrity relationships these days, rumors Lily-Rose Depp and rapper 070 Shake—whose real name is Danielle Balbuena but goes by Dani Moon—were dating started on DeuxMoi in February 2023. They were spotted together during the entirety of Parish Fashion Week and it didn’t take much longer for Depp to soft launch their relationship on her <a href=#>Instagram Story</a>. In March 2023, Depp shared another Insta Story of them kissing, and later that month, commemorated “4 MONTHS W MY CRUSH” to confirm their romance. Come June 2023 <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a> spotted them packing on the PDA during a day out shopping in New York.</p><p>A source told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a> in an article published in May 2023 that Depp’s father Johnny approved of the coupling. “Johnny was one of the first people to know about Danielle because Lily and him share everything with each other. He has not been the biggest fan of some of her ex-boyfriends, but there is a reason why Lily and these men did not work out. Johnny also thinks that it is super cool that his daughter is with a musician because he is a musician,” the source explained. &nbsp;</p><p>They continued: “He also sees similarities in style and overall vibe between himself and Danielle. They say that girls fall for guys like their dads, but it seems that girls fall for girls like their dads too. … Lily’s friends think that they complement each other so well. They are so tender and affectionate. Around their friends it is one ‘awww’ moment after another. She is such an authentic and real human being and surrounds herself with the same.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>Yassine Stein (November 2021 to 2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1440623962.jpg><p>In November 2021, Lily-Rose Depp confirmed her relationship with French rapper Yassine Stein during an outing in LA when they shared a kiss outside a local supermarket.

They were in 2016’s Yoga Hosers together and made an appearance with the rest of the cast at the Sundance Film Festival.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.912175648703><h2>Timothée Chalamet (2018 to 2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1171802902.jpg><p>By far one of her most highly publicized romances, Lily-Rose Depp and Timothée Chalamet met on the set of Netflix’s The King, which began filming in 2018. They were first spotted together in October of that year. “They were walking down the street and he stopped her and pulled her close,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;at the time. “They started making out for a while, for over a minute.”</p><p>After attending the Venice Film Festival, they had a few days to themselves and spent it in Capri where they were photographed by paparazzi making out on the deck of a yacht. It was a little awkward kiss; some of the public thought the photos were staged. In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>GQ</a> in 2020, Chalamet reflected on those photos. “I went to bed that night thinking that was one of the best days of my life,” Timothée told me. “I was on this boat all day with someone I really loved, and closing my eyes, I was like, indisputably, ‘That was great.’ And then waking up to all these pictures, and feeling&nbsp;embarrassed,&nbsp;and looking like a real&nbsp;nob? All&nbsp;pale? And then people are like: This is a PR stunt.&nbsp;A PR stunt?!&nbsp;Do you think I’d want to look like that in front of all of you?!”</p><p>Depp and Chalamet broke up after a year of dating, with the reason behind the split remaining unknown. Us Weekly confirmed the news, but in an interview with British Vogue, Chalamet described himself as “single”.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.98034934497817><h2>Ash Stymest (2015 to 2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-649082738.jpg><p>Lily-Rose Depp and model/musician Ash Stymest were first linked in 2015 after he married and later divorced fellow model Maille Stymest in 2011. With an eight-year age gap (Depp was 16 when they first got together), it definitely raised a few eyebrows. They split after two years of dating, <a href=#>JustJared</a> confirmed in April 2018. “LRD and Ash have decided to call it quits,” a source told the tabloid. &nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xpqjpZ2irnyttcuyZKuno5p6pbHPqWSdmaSeu6h7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flily-rose-depp-dating.html&text=Who%20Is%20Lily%20Rose%20Depp%20Dating%202023%3f%20Boyfriends%2c%20Girlfriends%20070%20Shake&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flily-rose-depp-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flily-rose-depp-dating.html&title=Who%20Is%20Lily%20Rose%20Depp%20Dating%202023%3f%20Boyfriends%2c%20Girlfriends%20070%20Shake" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flily-rose-depp-dating.html&title=Who%20Is%20Lily%20Rose%20Depp%20Dating%202023%3f%20Boyfriends%2c%20Girlfriends%20070%20Shake" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flily-rose-depp-dating.html&title=Who%20Is%20Lily%20Rose%20Depp%20Dating%202023%3f%20Boyfriends%2c%20Girlfriends%20070%20Shake" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flily-rose-depp-dating.html&description=Who%20Is%20Lily%20Rose%20Depp%20Dating%202023%3f%20Boyfriends%2c%20Girlfriends%20070%20Shake" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./500491-20-feminine-classy-thigh-tattoos-ideas-women-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 feminine classy thigh tattoos ideas for women in 2023">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./protein-mimicking-molecule-nyt-crossword.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Protein-mimicking molecule Crossword Clue">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
