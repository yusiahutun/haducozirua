She is an experienced technology analyst. She worked for Oaktree Capital Management, and her role at the firm was to identify opportunities for investment in new and emerging markets.</p><p class=align-left>She also worked at CNBC for 13 years. During this period, she held different positions and conducted her duties with utmost professionalism. At the beginning of her CNBC career, she served as the Director of Strategic Programming and Development. She also held an <i>Investing in America</i> event with the former president, Barack Obama, which led to an Emmy nomination.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/41457c9dbd9190bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>John Hughes and Kristen Welker: relationship story and children</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In this position, she also produced exclusive network shows featuring prominent business minds. Some of them were Bill Clinton, Timothy Geithner, and Warren Buffett. Between 2010 and 2011, her work station was in the Middle East. In her <a href=#>high-demand job</a>, she graciously interviewed business moguls, including Abdalla El-Badri and Ibrahi Al-Assaflike.</p><p class=align-left>She rose the ranks to become the chief energy correspondent at CNBC and also anchored for <i>Futures Now</i>. <i>Futures Now</i> was an online commodities programme.

Additionally, she is a dependable FOX Business Network financial correspondent.</p><h4>What is Jackie DeAngelis political party?</h4><p class=align-left>The journalist typically deals with business and political leaders who often have strong political opinions and views. Even so, she has remained nonpartisan in her career. She keeps her personal views on <a href=#>politics</a> away from her job, so her political party remains unknown in the public domain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2bd1321665277178.png><h3>Is Jackie DeAngelis married?</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike many journalists, DeAngelis has kept her private life away from the prying eye of the public.
