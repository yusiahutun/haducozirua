But for others, it’s a natural progression, and a way for them to tell the story of home wherever they go.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cultural diversity is not lacking in New York City, where the underground art world is run by Latinx and Black creatives. Still, breaking into the highbrow art bubble—the Chelsea gallery scene, Museum Mile—is a battle in trying to prove your worth, over and over and over again, especially to yourself.</p><img alt="heaven in bloom by maria de los angeles" title="heaven in bloom by maria de los angeles" width=1800 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-7a-heaven-in-bloom-acrylic-on-canvas-2019-photo-credit-ryan-bonilla-jpg-65205f3a3752f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ryan Bonilla</span><p>Maria de Los Angeles, Heaven in Bloom, 2019, acrylic on canvas</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, a new wave of artists—including Jean-Pierre Villafañe, Maria de Los Angeles, and Aerosyn-Lex Meštrović—are breaking the bounds of what it means to be an immigrant artist in America with the ways they choose to embrace their roots. Meanwhile, projects like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/concordia.nyc/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Concordia Art Show" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Concordia Art Show</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/tumbao.popup/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Tumbao class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tumbao</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/unidos.world/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Unidos class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Unidos</a>, Mad54, Chevere Means Cool, and Proxyco Gallery, which showcase work by Hispanic artists, are helping launch a new era of recognition for the community.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Representation of culture is always inherent in anyone’s work,” says Valentina Pozo, of Hispanic art-and-design pop-up shop Tumbao. “Where you come from helps shape your behavior, your ideas, your art. The problem is that the public is expecting explicit cultural representation rather than looking for more nuanced representation. If you let artists create without having to fulfill people’s expectations, then you get to see work that reflects the multidimensionality of a culture.”</p><img alt="work by valeria divinorum for her lincoln center show" title="work by valeria divinorum for her lincoln center show" width=1800 height=2700 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2023-09-05-valeriahaedostudiovisit-lawrencesumulong-0079-jpg-651f07b879e16.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lawrence Sumulong/Lincoln Center</span><p>Work by Valeria Divinorum</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, eight Latinx, NYC-based artists to obsess over this Hispanic Heritage Month, and beyond.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1.

He studied architecture for most of his life before transitioning to painting—and thank goodness for that. Last month, his work was exhibited at the Armory Show with gallery <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/embajadada/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Embajada class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Embajada</a>, and his large-scale paintings can also be found in temporary exhibitions around the city, as well as at West Village restaurant Cecchi’s.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On his art</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Painting is a lot of improvisation. Even once I start a piece, it’s very much like, Will I walk down this path, or this other one? And I just let myself be surprised by where I end up,” he says. “I think to find the right composition, you have to lose yourself, escape reality, and give in to the illusion.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His paintings exude a sort of dark, circus-freak glamour that is both incredibly nostalgic—think New York City nightlife in the 1920s Prohibition years—and highly relevant.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It has a lot to do with this post-pandemic world of opulence and excess. Everyone is in heels. The clothing is animated and has a life of its own,” Villafañe says. The work is also a commentary on consumerism and exhibitionism, as he plays with the idea of the home as a social space and the public space as a form of improv theater.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“During the pandemic we were living through a very controversial time, politically, so some of my characters allude to those in politics. I also incorporate bizarre characters I meet in real life, like the lawyer who does drugs, or the banker who does drag after hours,” he says. “By putting them together, I’m saying that no matter what everyone’s role in life is, you can all end up in the same space—in a bathroom inside the same house party. It’s contrasts and it’s escapism and it’s satire.”</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On representation</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“[Puerto Rico] has always been a culture of carnivals and celebrations. Everyone is always dancing, and the one person at a party not dancing is watching, entranced by the movement,” Villafañe says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His mother was a dance teacher, and, he says, she would force him to dance salsa and bachata—but he was always more interested in dance from the point of view of the spectator, “who gets to witness these bodies moving in a way that is almost architectural. The way the movement seems choreographed but is actually a spontaneous response to the other bodies around you.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aside from salsa, flamenco has also been a big inspiration to Villafañe—the colors, the drama, the passion, and the geometry of the limbs during a dance.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On community</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“A lot of Latinx artists who I met here have gone back to Puerto Rico. It’s always a home we can’t entirely leave,” he says. “There’s definitely a community of Latinx artists here; we rarely get together, but when we do meet, it’s really life-changing. It’s not easy to build those relationships when, as fine artists, a lot of the time we are locked up in our studios, painting for 12 hours without going outside. You feel like a stranger in the outside world, sometimes—it’s surreal. But I will say that a lot of the Puerto Ricans here who’ve seen my work find it refreshing that I’m not just painting palm trees and coconuts, but am instead trying to represent my culture in a more fun, interesting way.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">2. Maria de Los Angeles</h2><img alt="citizen dress by maria de los angeles" title="citizen dress by maria de los angeles" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-1-citizen-dress-we-the-people-exhibition-crystal-image-1-citizen-dress-crystal-bridges-museum-of-art-ryan-bonilla-2022-2023-651f05a5c2048.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ryan Bonilla</span><p>Maria de Los Angeles, Citizen Dress, 2019–21, American flag, denim, and paint on canvas</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Born in Mexico, raised in California, and now based in New York City, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://shivagallery.org/maria-de-los-angeles/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Maria de Los Angeles" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Maria de Los Angeles</a> lived most of her life hiding in plain sight, as an undocumented immigrant. Throughout the years, her works of art have told the story of that struggle, finding beauty and hope in displacement, and using color, shape, and texture to communicate thoughts on migration, identity, politics, and what it means to belong.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On art and representation</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s not necessarily a condition of the artist that you kind of speak about your environment, but I think our environment is so in us,” she says. “For me, living without documents as a child and coming to terms with that as an adult … you start to ask questions, you realize that there is a type of story going on. It wasn’t super intentional, but at some point it was something that I needed to analyze through my work, through my drawings, through my pieces to self-heal and to understand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“And when you speak about an experience that has political urgency—like, we still don’t have comprehensive immigration reform in this country—it can create a sense of belonging. I also think art crosses a lot of social and economic levels,” she adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While some of de Los Angeles’s works are flat paintings and sketches, others are wearable garments with bold messages and symbols. Her Citizen Dress, for example, deals with the complexities of belonging to a country and balancing certain identities. It was recently purchased by the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas for its permanent collection.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Xuxa Rodríguez, a curator at the museum, says of the piece: “The work engages themes of [Latinx] cultural practices and intersectional identities, one that centers Mexico to U.S. migration narratives and [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] experiences. The loose brushwork that she uses throughout the sculpture’s paintings and drawings reflects her automatic drawing style, where she draws from memory rather than using reference images, a practice that amplifies the work’s themes of imagining a nation, its peoples, and their ideals.”</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On community</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The Latinx art scene in New York, even just compared to 20 years ago, has become so much more diverse,” de Los Angeles says. “I feel like we have much more of a presence, you know? Every Mexican consulate has an exhibition space. Like, there’s just so much more happening now.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She adds that Hispanic creatives are everywhere in the city, but you wouldn’t necessarily know that by just going gallery hopping. “I think it has to do with the commercialization of art, that when you enter a gallery in Chelsea, for example, it’s much more about the money and the selling or the or the art. And fairs are very much about the collectors and the galleries,” she says. “So, I think it’s important for us to have spaces where it’s centered around sharing ideas and sharing voices and not necessarily about the money.”</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">3.

She has an exhibition at Lincoln Center, which closes this coming Sunday, October 8.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On her art</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When I was studying architecture in Buenos Aires, I was living with my mother, a glass artist. I watched her work, and right after I finished university, I started being more interested in artistic expressions through architecture,” Divinorum says. “I was specifically interested in sacred geometry—the mathematical proportions and patterns that appear in nature, in flowers, in our bodies, and every single thing that exists and has life.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A mentor and friend of her mother taught her to do the Tiffany technique, which involves wrapping the edges of glass pieces with a thin copper foil before soldering them together, and from there, her creativity kicked off and never stopped.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There is a spiritual meaning in my work. These patterns, I think they’re universal. There are also no barriers in art, like in language or culture. We can all identify with this and feel like we belong to it,” she says. “I like that I never know how the projection of the light is going to look like in different spaces; it’s like a metaphor for my life that whenever I try to control things and make sure everything is going to go the way I want, you know, it doesn’t—and when I let go control, I let in surprises and magical things happen.”</p><h2 data-node-id=42 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On representation</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Divinorum says that in her case, the way she embraces her roots is in her craft and in her routine. The glass artistry itself was passed down to her by her mother, and her in-studio process includes drinking cup after cup of hot maté, a traditional Argentinian green tea.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When you explore your creative skills, you try to find things that you identify with and express your emotions in your work. The emotions that I carry in my life are definitely impacted by the reality I lived in,” she explains. “Being South American and the culture that I grew up in definitely impacts the message I want to share with the world, so it doesn’t feel like an effort to me to find a way to share how I represent my own culture.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“With maté, it’s like a community where you share the same metallic straw with the herbs in it with your friends or anyone that comes, even if maybe you don'’ even know the person,” she says, adding that that same attitude of community and collaboration is something she incorporates into her work and daily life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In the show there’s going to be flashlights and sculptures that people are going to be able to touch and feel and play with, and then the art creation becomes more a collective thing, more than just one single person representing,” Divinorum says. “So, I do believe that that also comes from being South American and that idea of sharing everything.”</p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On community</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I actually have a huge community of Latin American artist friends in New York City; and in Ridgewood, Queens, where I live, I have a garden and we do readings of poetry and all sorts of art activities like DIY things,” she says. “I also belong to a big, queer collective of Latin American artists.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She adds that working on the Lincoln Center exhibit allowed her to welcome other underrepresented artists into the scene, as she was able to bring on various transgender and queer craftspeople to help with the installation and production of her show. “I am a super independent underground artist to have this opportunity, and then I wanted to share that opportunity with my friends,” she says.</p><h2 data-node-id=50 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">4.

I was studying film in New York, and I wanted to become a director, but I also had a passion for design and was interested in fashion. I never thought of set design as a career, but the opportunities presented themselves, and it’s been a very fulfilling journey.”</p><h2 data-node-id=56 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On representation</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Much of my inspiration comes from growing up in a city where chaos and beauty coexist. I find Mexico City surreal and magical, so I infuse that into my work,” he says. “For me, it’s not about putting a reference that’s in your face, you know? I’m Mexican, but I’m not going to use the cliché version of my culture. I dissect and then choose what I think is relevant for the moment to take as a reference. I’m very inspired by Mexican muralists and how they would create a mise-en-scène. See a Diego Rivera or [a</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">José Clemente] Orozco mural, and the ‘set’ elements are so great.”</p><h2 data-node-id=60 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On community</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I moved to New York City in 2013 and started working on set. The industry felt different; there was very little diversity in the people creating images. At that point, I didn’t find a community, but I did make a lot of friends that later would become close collaborators and serve as inspiration for my work,” Irigoyen says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He adds that in recent years, the industry has shifted due to the democratization of images through social media, allowing more variety of cultures, backgrounds, ages, and genders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The energy on set is now more relaxed and fun than before. People were taking fashion too seriously back then,” he says. “Now, I’m friends with so many Latinos working in the industry, and forming that community feels good and grounding. I have been in shoots where we are all Latinos playing bachata and having a great time dancing and working.”</p><h2 data-node-id=64 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">5.

Whether it be my large-scale ‘Living Paintings’ series shown at the MoMA, or the calligraphic works created for the White House, or the murals in Miami, my work always seeks to evoke emotion from the viewer.”</p><h2 data-node-id=69 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On representation</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=70 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think representation is an unfortunate expectation which comes from the need for critics, curators, and other gatekeepers within the art world to easily categorize and qualify an artist’s work,” he says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=72 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meštrović believes that while some artists explore this in a genuine way, to translate their own narratives through image, others “lean on this expectation as a way to establish an identity without really digging deeper.” He adds, “For myself, my experience immigrating to this country and growing up with humble means definitely affected my experiences, but I don’t think that’s defined me. I personally want to reflect a wider worldview of how modern cultures and languages influence each other, and how that evolves our own globalized cultural signifiers and discourse.”</p><h2 data-node-id=74 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On community</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=75 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“For me, art has always been a lonely pursuit. Although I collaborate endlessly with some of the world’s biggest brands and interface with myriad teams, most of the creative heavy lifting happens when I’m alone,” he says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=77 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meštrović explains that because he lives in both New York City and Tokyo, he has a varied group of artists friends all over, though he does stay in close contact with a Latinx artist crew called Alianza, whom he met at Pratt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=79 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I definitely feel that the way we define art and artists has changed in the past decade or so. I suppose it’s an ever-evolving pursuit, but I think there is more access to art than ever before, and more access to the tools with which to create art. With that, I think there are more people than ever aspiring to be artists,” he says. “Finding a sense of community within that pursuit can be difficult, but I do think in general that the Latinx art community in New York City has grown, although it’s perhaps not so tightly connected, nor as centrally situated as before.”</p><h2 data-node-id=80 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">6.

In his hometown he studied journalism, but after working as an assistant to legendary Chilean photographer Gabriel Schkolnick, he decided to make photography his main focus. He moved to New York City five years ago and has since worked for brands like Burberry, Luar, Kate Spade, and Club Monaco, and his work has also been featured in publications including Vogue México y Latinoamérica, V magazine, Wonderland, and GQ.</p><h2 data-node-id=83 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On his art</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=84 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’ve always been fascinated by the evolution of our society, and where we are headed as a whole. Since we are only in the world for a short period of time, I try to shoot images that will last longer, and for me it’s always bringing a little of the past into my idea of the future,” he says. “Probably my background as a journalist is a big part of that storytelling, but at the same time, it’s always about shaping reality to portray my own expectations and ideas of what we are.”</p><h2 data-node-id=85 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On representation</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=86 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Chile as a territory had most of its culture erased by the colonization and, after that, stunted by the military dictatorship. My way of representing our culture is to portray people and realities that others decide not to see,” Robles says. “Being queer in Latin America wasn’t as easy as it might feel in New York City. Representing sexual dissidence is a big part for me, to feel I’m doing the correct thing in terms of my cultural views and my ideas of our evolution. I have been collaborating with the brand K.ngsley for a few seasons, a queer and Black-owned brand that is also building a strong community in the city.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=87 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Last year, Robles shot a story for L’Officiel México in which he captured 12 different faces from different Latin backgrounds. “These are the kinds of people that inspire me to keep doing this,” he says.</p><h2 data-node-id=88 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On community</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=89 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“This is a city that never stays the same, but I’ve managed to find really good friends that come from different parts of Latin America,” he says. “An example of this is a jeans campaign that I shot for Luar, a brand owned by Raul Lopez, a Latin American creative [who] has been building a Hispanic community in New York for a few years, a collaborative community that provides support to its talents.”</p><h2 data-node-id=90 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">7.

Every artist has a unique story to share, even if it’s not portrayed literally. This personal touch is what makes it great! It is always exciting to see how our community blends different ideas and experiences to create a powerful message,” he says. “I am striving to be genuine and truthful in the way I represent my culture. Undoubtedly, my Brazilian and Chilean roots have shaped the way I express myself. My choices, such as color, texture, and even the portrayal of a subject, are influenced by a nostalgic perspective.”</p><h2 data-node-id=98 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>On community</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=99 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There is a beautiful and strong community of Latinxs in New York City, and I think it is pretty united,” he says. “I can easily say that most of my work is connected at some point with Latinx talents and friends.

As immigrants, your community becomes your family and there is a lot of longing in the culture that gets lost in the move. It can be expected, but I think that is where the creative eye can flip the conversation,” Valdés says. “Your culture has the first things you see and ever know of, so it is only natural that some of these factors end up in your work, literally or subjectively.
