He is 91 years old as of 2022, and his zodiac is Capricorn. His father, Robert Earl Jones (1910 – 2006), was a boxer, butler, and chauffeur, while his mother, Ruth Williams (1911 – 1986), was a teacher and maid.</p><p class=align-left>Both his parents were of mixed African-American (Irish and native American ancestry). <a href=#>The star</a> has a sibling named Mathew Earl Jones. Shortly after James’ birth, his father left the family and went to be a stage and screen actor in New York and Hollywood. As a result, James never got to know his father until later on in his life after their reconciliation in the 1950s.</p><p class=align-left>When he was five years old, he went to live with his maternal grandparents John Henry and Maggie Connolly. He was raised at their farm in Jackson, Michigan. The grandparents initially lived in Mississippi but were forced to move during the Great Migration.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/482d25ac435a3310.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Robert Patrick: wife, net worth, background, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The transition to living with the grandparents turned out to be traumatic for James; hence he developed severe stuttering. He attended the Browning School before moving to the Dickson Rural Agricultural School, from where he graduated as vice president of his class.</p><p class=align-left>Thanks to his <a href=#>gift</a> for writing poetry, his English teacher encouraged him to speak by reading poetry aloud in class, and he was able to overcome the disorder. He went to the University of Michigan, initially a pre-med major but changed to drama and graduated in 1955.</p><h3>Career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9873971d1ad17dc7.png><p class=align-left>Before graduating from <a href=#>college</a>, James joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, where he excelled.
