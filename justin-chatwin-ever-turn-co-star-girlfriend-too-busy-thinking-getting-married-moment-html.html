Even if the personal life of celebrities is kept behind the curtains, their fans and followers will never stop finding out the information about their life off the screen. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In this context, we will be talking about Shameless star Justin Chatwin. What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you see Justin on screen? Have you ever wondered about his relationship and affair? If you are willing to know about his love life, then you are in the right place.</p><h2>Is Justin Seeing Or Dating Any Of His Co-stars?</h2><p>There might be some of you who wished Justin’s on-screen affair to come right. When all the fans and followers of Justin are wondering about his relationship status, he hasn’t uttered a single word about his love life. Well, we can say that he has kept the information about his personal life under wraps. While Justin has chosen to maintain privacy in his personal life, many rumors about him being a gay have hovered. Well, he is straight by sexuality and has shared posts related gay on the social media which might have confused people about his sexuality.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, Justin was previously <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spotted</a> strolling with Addison Timlin in Venice, Calif in October 2010.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Caption: Justin Chatwin was spotted walking with Addison Timlin in Venice, Calif in October 2010.</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Photo Credit: justjared.com</p><p>It seems that he was in a secret relationship as he made no any comments about his affair with this Addison Timlin. Since then, Justin has never been spotted with any mysterious lady who could be assumed as his love interest. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Justin is also known for his long relationship with actress Molly Sims. They dated for four years from 2005 to 2009. Meanwhile, he was also rumored to be dating Margarita Levieva in 2007.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Caption: Justin Chatwin and his ex-girlfriend Molly Sims poses for the camera.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: wireimage.com</p><p>Justin might be single now, or else keeping his affairs under wrap. If he is single, he might not have any time to find his lady love. The way Justin is marking his place in the film industry; it seems that he will be too dedicated towards his work rather than get married in the years to come.So all the fans of Justin must wait to see him enjoying a happy marital life with his wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>More About Justin Chatwin:</h2><p>Canadian actor Justin Chatwin was born on October 31, 1982, to Brian, an engineer, and Suzanne, an artist.
