However, he didn’t actually, in a sense, because he didn’t show up to accept them officially.</strong></p><p>The Golden Raspberry Awards are marking their 44th year in 2024. Starting back in 1981, it was the brainchild of two UCLA film graduates and movie veterans who wanted to highlight the worst in the previous year of <a href=#>Hollywood</a>. Normal <a href=#>award shows</a> celebrate achievements and amazing performances by stars and those who work behind the scenes, but not the Razzies. It began after the co-founder was driving home after seeing a ‘bad’ film and wondered if they should be recognized for it. That’s how the Razzie award was born, and <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> is up there with a high number of nominations and winners himself. Although, the top winner goes to <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a>, who has been awarded 10 times. We’re not sure how Sly feels about that.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-578546876-1-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-donald-trump-has-been-nominated-for-a-razzie-four-times>Donald Trump has been nominated for a Razzie four times</h2><p>The Apprentice Star has had small parts and cameos in <a href=#>movies</a> – remember Home Alone 2? But the <a href=#>celebrity</a> also made his mark on TV with his business reality show.</p><p>He has dipped his toes in all areas of show business, whether it was <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrestling at WrestleMania</a>, or owning the Miss USA pageant.</p><p>But Donald Trump’s rollercoaster of a career was also highlighted at the infamous Razzie awards more than once.</p><p>Some stars show they can take a joke and actually turn up to accept their Razzie, like <a href=#>Sandra Bullock’s acceptance speech</a>. Out of all the nominees and years of the Raspberries, only 10 famous faces have done so, though.</p><p>The show acknowledge more than just actors, script writers and directors though.</p><p>In total, Donald Trump has won three Razzies, losing out on his fourth nomination.</p><p>He first made it onto the list for his part in the 1990 flick Ghosts Can’t Do It. He played himself in the movie – a common appearance – and was up for Worst New Star and Worst Supporting Actor. Trump one the second award.</p><p>The 77-year-old was recognized again at the 39th awards for being nominated in the categories of Worst Actor and Worst Screen Combo. He was on the list for being referred to in political documentaries, Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 11/9 and Dinesh D’Souza’s Death Of A Nation: Can We Save America A Second Time?</p><p>The Worst Screen Combo Award was for ‘His Self Perpetuating Pettiness’ on an international stage (ie, him being President) and he won it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-re-still-waiting-for-him-to-pick-it-up>They’re still ‘waiting’ for him to pick it up</h2><p>Trump never picked up his trophy, but the Razzie awards are eagerly waiting for Donald to swing by to get it.</p><p>But co-founders John Wilson and Mo Murphy told The Huffington Post they still have his 1981 Razzie, and waiting for the day he’ll take it off their hands.</p><p>They <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “We have it proudly displayed on the mantle at our Los Angeles headquarters. Hoping Trump will pick it up soon before it all falls to pieces.</p><p>“We’d like to get it out of here and place it with its rightful owner, in the office where he currently displays a very sad performance to a frightened world audience.”</p><p>When asked if the former President of the United States ever responded to being nominated, they admit he didn’t. But it’s common for the satire event.</p><p>“No, but we’d love to send it to him to display on the Oval Office mantle,” they said when he was in office.</p><p>“It is, after all, the&nbsp;only&nbsp;showbiz award he’s ever “won.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WGcLDOp5ilnF2pv7a5z2afmqtdrLyvedOhqZ6dXaTCtXnOn2Sfp6WnerOt2bOgnmWRrK6zsNJmmKecXaS7pnnWmqpmnp%2BneqOxyKeeZqCZosCmuMVo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdonald-trump-has-won-three-out-of-four-razzie-awards-and-one-was-for-being-himself.html&text=Donald%20Trump%20has%20won%20three%20out%20of%20four%20Razzie%20awards%20and%20one%20was%20for%20%27being%20himself%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdonald-trump-has-won-three-out-of-four-razzie-awards-and-one-was-for-being-himself.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdonald-trump-has-won-three-out-of-four-razzie-awards-and-one-was-for-being-himself.html&title=Donald%20Trump%20has%20won%20three%20out%20of%20four%20Razzie%20awards%20and%20one%20was%20for%20%27being%20himself%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdonald-trump-has-won-three-out-of-four-razzie-awards-and-one-was-for-being-himself.html&title=Donald%20Trump%20has%20won%20three%20out%20of%20four%20Razzie%20awards%20and%20one%20was%20for%20%27being%20himself%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdonald-trump-has-won-three-out-of-four-razzie-awards-and-one-was-for-being-himself.html&title=Donald%20Trump%20has%20won%20three%20out%20of%20four%20Razzie%20awards%20and%20one%20was%20for%20%27being%20himself%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdonald-trump-has-won-three-out-of-four-razzie-awards-and-one-was-for-being-himself.html&description=Donald%20Trump%20has%20won%20three%20out%20of%20four%20Razzie%20awards%20and%20one%20was%20for%20%27being%20himself%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ed-mcmahon-and-pam-mcmahon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ed McMahon and Pam McMahon">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bill-advances-to-cover-iowa-special-education-funding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bill advances to cover Iowa special education funding">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
